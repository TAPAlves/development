533: (213810710238917599) patent: US20080138851A1 Title : TROPHIC CONVERSION OF OBLIGATE PHOTOTROPHIC ALGAE THROUGH METABOLIC ENGINEERING) Abstract : Most microalgae are obligate photoautotrophs and their growth is strictly dependent on the generation of photosynthetically-derived energy. In this study it is shown that the microalga Phaeodaclylurn tricornutum can be engineered to import glucose and grow in the dark through the introduction of genes encoding glucose transporters. Both the human and Chlorella kessleri glucose transporters facilitated the uptake of glucose by P. tricornutum, allowing the cells to metabolize exogenous organic carbon and thrive, independent of light. This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene.; Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization. Finally, this work also represents critical progress toward large-scale commercial exploitation of obligate phototrophic algae through the use of microbial fermentation technology, eliminating significant limitations resulting from light-dependent growth.)

566: (3338872243402173120) patent: US8008061B2 Title : TROPHIC CONVERSION OF OBLIGATE PHOTOTROPHIC ALGAE THROUGH METABOLIC ENGINEERING) Abstract : Most microalgae are obligate photoautotrophs and their growth is strictly dependent on the generation of photosynthetically-derived energy. In this study it is shown that the microalga Phaeodaclylurn tricornutum can be engineered to import glucose and grow in the dark through the introduction of genes encoding glucose transporters. Both the human and Chlorella kessleri glucose transporters facilitated the uptake of glucose by P. tricornutum, allowing the cells to metabolize exogenous organic carbon and thrive, independent of light. This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene.; Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization. Finally, this work also represents critical progress toward large-scale commercial exploitation of obligate phototrophic algae through the use of microbial fermentation technology, eliminating significant limitations resulting from light-dependent growth.)

"Sea squirt (ascidian)" is a generic name of marine animals which belong to class Ascidiacea, subphylum Urochordata (Tunicata), phylum Chordata and which live nationwide. As described above, sea squirt (ascidian) is abundantly found as resources. In the present invention, fucoxanthinol is extracted particularly from internal organs and hard skins of sea squirt (ascidian), and it has been revealed that fucoxanthinol exhibits strong anti-obesity activity.)
