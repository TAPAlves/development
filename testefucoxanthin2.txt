Moreover, it has been required to develop an agent having an enhanced antiobesity activity. Thus, it is intended to specify a carotenoid having a stronger antiobesity activity than fucoxanthin and provide an agent having an antiobesity activity and a method of inhibiting obesity by using the same. [MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS] As the results of intensive studies for finding a carotenoid having a stronger antiobesity activity than fucoxanthin and a material for economically obtaining the same, it is found out that these problems can be solved by using ascidian. Ascidian is a general name involving marine animals belonging to the phylum Chordata, the subphylum Urochordata, and the class Ascidiacea and these animals widely occur throughout the country. Fucoxanthinol is extracted from, in particular, the internal organs and shell of ascidian and it is clarified that this substance has a strong antiobesity activity.)

As alternatives to silver particles, other metallic particles (e. g. zinc, copper) or nanocrystalline actives can be incorporated (e. g. replacing the anti-oxidative silver by anti-oxidative nanocrystals of plant molecules such as hesperitin).

In one advantageous embodiment, the bubble column is a multi-stage loop-flow flotation column that has three loop-flow zones, each of which is defined by a draft tube concentrically mounted in the column to divide each loop-flow zone into a riser and the downcomer. Fine bubbles of gas and brine are in cocurrent upward flow in the riser and in cocurrent downward flow the downcomer. A higher gas holdup is promoted in the riser than in the downcomer, thereby circulating the brine in loop-flow upwardly through the riser and downwardly through the downcomer. Liquid communication between adjacent loop-flow zones is substantially eliminated. A froth enriched in algae is generated that can be separated from the aqueous suspension. The process has application in the recovery of mixed carotenoids from Dunaliella salina.)

The algal cells are ruptured sufficiently to promote froth flotation of the cells from the suspension. The algal suspension is introduced into the top of the Jameson cell downcomer and passed through an orifice plate therein to generate a free liquid jet of the suspension. The jet is plunged downwardly through a gas and the gas is transported with the jet through a gas and liquid interface into the algal suspension. The momentum of the jet is dissipated, which disperses the gas into fine bubbles. The fine bubbles are intimately contacted with the aqueous suspension in cocurrent downward flow in a collection zone to absorb the algal bodies onto the surfaces of the bubbles. A froth of bubble and algal agglomerates is formed and collapsed to obtain a dewatered algal concentrate. The Jameson cell can be operated at sufficient inlet pressures so that the algal cells are ruptured by passing them through the orifice rather than in a separate step.)

In this study it is shown that the microalga Phaeodaclylurn tricornutum can be engineered to import glucose and grow in the dark through the introduction of genes encoding glucose transporters. Both the human and Chlorella kessleri glucose transporters facilitated the uptake of glucose by P. tricornutum, allowing the cells to metabolize exogenous organic carbon and thrive, independent of light. This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene.; Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization. Finally, this work also represents critical progress toward large-scale commercial exploitation of obligate phototrophic algae through the use of microbial fermentation technology, eliminating significant limitations resulting from light-dependent growth.)

In this study it is shown that the microalga Phaeodaclylurn tricornutum can be engineered to import glucose and grow in the dark through the introduction of genes encoding glucose transporters. Both the human and Chlorella kessleri glucose transporters facilitated the uptake of glucose by P. tricornutum, allowing the cells to metabolize exogenous organic carbon and thrive, independent of light. This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene.; Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization. Finally, this work also represents critical progress toward large-scale commercial exploitation of obligate phototrophic algae through the use of microbial fermentation technology, eliminating significant limitations resulting from light-dependent growth.)

The algal cells are ruptured sufficiently to promote froth flotation of the cells from the suspension. The algal suspension is introduced into the top of the Jameson cell downcomer and passed through an orifice plate therein to generate a free liquid jet of the suspension. The jet is plunged downwardly through a gas and the gas is transported with the jet through a gas and liquid interface into the algal suspension. The momentum of the jet is dissipated, which disperses the gas into fine bubbles. The fine bubbles are intimately contacted with the aqueous suspension in concurrent downward flow in a collection zone to absorb the algal bodies onto the surfaces of the bubbles. A froth of bubble and algal agglomerates is formed and collapsed to obtain a dewatered algal concentrate. The Jameson cell can be operated at sufficient inlet pressures so that the algal cells are ruptured by passing them through the orifice rather than in a separate step.)
