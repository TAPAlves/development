CA2856646A1	Combination treatment of cancer	The present invention relates to a combination comprising AZD5363, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one androgen receptor signalling modulator selected from MDV-3100 (also known as enzalutamide), AZD3514, abiraterone (or an ester prodrug thereof: e.g. abiraterone acetate), and bicalutamide; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Each of these combinations may be useful in the treatment of cancer. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such combinations, and further relates to methods of treatment comprising the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of AZD5363, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with at least one androgen receptor signalling modulator as described above, to warm-blooded animal, such as a human for the treatment of cancer. The invention also relates to a kit comprising such combinations.
CN101027059B	Combination comprising ZD6474 and imatinib and pharmaceutical uses thereof	The present invention relates to a method for the production of an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal such as a human which is optionally being treated with ionising radiation, particularly a method for the treatment of a cancer, particularly a cancer involving a solid tumour or a leukaemia, which comprises the administration of ZD6474 in combination with imatinib; to a pharmaceutical composition comprising ZD6474 and imatinib; to a combination product comprising ZD6474 and imatinib for use in a method of treatment of a human or animal body bytherapy; to a kit comprising ZD6474 and imatinib; to the use of ZD6474 and imatinib in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the production of an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal such as a human which is optionally being treated with ionising radiation.
