[ 0001 ] The present invention re|ates to combinations of imazaliL or a salt thereof , and hydroxypyridones which provide an improved biocida| effect. More particu|ar|y , the present invention re|ates to compositions comprising a combination of imazali| , or. a sa|t thereof , together with one or more hydroxypyridones se|ected from 1—hydroxy - 2 - . ' pyridinone , cic|opirox , cic|opirox o|amine , piroctone , piroctone olamine and rilopirox in. respective proportions to provide a synergistic biocida| effect. Compositions comprising these combinations are usefu| for the protection of any living or non—|iving materiaL‘ such as crops , plants , fruits , seeds , objects made of wood , thatch or the like , engineering materiaL biodegradable material and texti|es against deterioration due to the action of microorganisms such as bacteria , fungi , yeasts , a|gae , virusses , and the |ike. [ 0002 ] Microorganisms are extreme|y usefu| , and even indispensab|e , in processes such as , e. g. alcoho|ic fermentation , ripening of cheese , baking of bread , production of penici||in , purification of waste water , production of biogas , and the like. However , microorganisms can also be harmful or high|y dangerous ; by causing infectious diseases , by forming poisonous or carcinogenic metaboIites and by attacking va|uab|e. materia|s , disturbing production processes , or impairment of the qua|ity of products. [ 0003 ] Biocides or microbiocides are a broad and diverse group of compounds which are ab|e to contro| microorganisms : i. e. to e|iminate , ki||. or inhibit microorganisms , or to reduce the growth or pro|iferation of microorganisms such as bacteria , fungi , yeasts and algae. An important group of the biocides are the bactericides and fungicides. Since bacteria and fungi occur everywhere , their destructive activity ( biodeterioration ) is basica||y unavoidab|e. Neverthe|ess objects can be protected with the aid of compounds that prevent the mu|tiplication of bacteria or fungi at the re|evant sites , either by ki||ing them or inhibiting their deve|opment. [ 0004 ] Fungicidal combinations comprising the - antifunga| agents imaza|i| , pyrimethani| or thiabendazole have been disc|osed in , e. g. EP - 0 , 336 , 489 which describes combinations of imaza|il and propiconazo|e , WO - 99 / 12422 which describes combinations of imaza|il and epoxiconazo|e and WO - 03 / 01103O which describes. fungicida| compositions comprising pyrimethani| and imazalil. - 10. 15. 20.

This enumeration of cu|ture p|ants is given with the purpose of i||ustrating the invention and not to de|imiting it thereto. ' . [ O023 ] |n an embodiment , the present invention re|ates to a method of control|ing microbial growth on pIants , parts of p|ants , fruit and seeds , _which comprises app|ying an antimicrobia||y effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of component ( l ) and one or more components ( l| ) in respective ‘proportions to provide a synergistic biocida| effect , to the p|ants , parts of p|ants , fruit and seeds to be treated. [ 0024 ] The re|ative proportions of component ( | ) and a component ( || ) in compositions comprising a combination of component ( l ) and one of the components ( |l ) are those proportions which resuIt in a synergistic biocidal effect , when compared to a composition incIuding , as an active ingredient , either component ( l ) alone or one of the components ( || ) a|one. As wi|| be understood by those skil|ed in the art , the said synergistic effect may be obtained within various proportions of components ( | ) and ( || ) in the composition , depending on the kind of microorganism towards which effect is measured and the substrate to be treated. Based on the teachings of the present app|ication , determination of the synergistic effect of such combinations can be performed according to the procedures of the Poison P|ate Assay as described in. WO 2009 / 027473 PCT / EP2008 / 061312. 10. 15. 2O. 25. 30. 35. Experiment 1. As a genera| ru|e , however , it may be said that for most microorganisms the suitab|e proportions by weight of the amount of component ( l ) to component ( |l ) in the active composition should lie in the. range from 10 : 1 to 1 : 10. ' Particu|arly , this range is from 4 : 1 to 1 : 4 , more particu|arly from 3 : 1 to 1 : 3 or 2 : 1 to 1 : 2. Another particu|ar ratio of component ( | ) to component ( || ) in the compositions of the present invention is‘ a 1 : 1 ratio between component ( | ) and component ( |l ) . I. [ 0025 ] The quantity of each of the active ingredients in the compositions according to the present invention will be so that a synergistic biocida| effect is obtained. |n particu|ar it is contemp|ated that the ready to use compositions of the present invention comprise component ( l ) in a range from 10 to 50.000 mg / L The component ( l| ) is. 0 present in an amount ranging from 10 to 50.000 mg / l or mg / kg depending upon the. specific activity of the selected component ( l| ) . [ 0026 ] The concentration of component ( l ) and one of the components ( |l ) in the . ready to use compositions is a|so dependent upon the specific conditions wherein these compositions are used. For instance , in fo|iar treatment a so|ution is sprayed direct|y onto the |eaves wherein the concentration of component ( | ) ranges from 100 mg to 250 mg / |. Potatoes are treated with a composition comprising component ( | ) in an amount of about 7500 mg / | in such a manner that a so|ution of 2 |itres is used for treating 1.000 kg. m the treatment of seed the compositions used comprise component ( | ) in an amount of about 50 g / l in such a manner that 100 kg of seed is treated with a solution of 100 m| to 200 ml. |n the post - harvest treatment of fruit compositions are used comprising component ( | ) in an amount ranging from 250 to 500 mg / | in dip treatment , from 500 to 1.000 mg / | in spray treatment , and from 1.000 to 2.000 mg / | in wax treatment. [ 0027 ] The compositions according to the present invention comprise as a combination of component ( | ) and one or more components ( || ) in respective proportions to provide a synergistic biocida| effect , and optiona||y one or more acceptab|e carriers. [ 0028 ] These carriers are any materia| or substance with which the composition of components ( l ) and ( || ) is formulated in order to faci|itate its app|ication / dissemination to the |ocus to be treated , for instance by disso|ving , dispersing , or diffusing the said composition , and / or to faci|itate its storage , transport or handling without impairing its antifunga| effectiveness. Said acceptab|ecarriers may be a so|id or a liquid or a gas which has been compressed to form a liquid , i. e. the compositions of this invention can. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. WO 2009 / 027473 ' PCT / EP2008 / 061312. suitably be used as concentrates , emulsions , emu|sifiab|e concentrates , oi| miscib|e suspension concentrates , oi| - miscible |iquid , so|ub|e concentrates , solutions , granu|ates , dusts , sprays , aerosols , pe||ets , or powders. [ 0029 ] |n many instances the biocida| compositions to be used direct|y can be obtained from concentrates , such as e. g. emu|sifiab|e concentrates , suspension concentrates , or soluble concentrates , upon di|ution with aqueous or organic media , such concentrates being intended to be covered by the term composition as used in the definitions of the present invention. Such concentrates can be di|uted to a ready to use mixture in a spray tank shortly before use. Preferany the compositions of the invention shou|d contain from about 0.01 to 95% by weight of the combination of components ( l ) and ( || ) . More preferably this range is from O.1 to 90% by weight. Most preferab|y this range is from 1 to 80% by weight , depending on the type of formu|ation to be se|ected for specific app|ication purposes , as further exp|ained in detai|s hereinafter. [ 0030 ] An emu|sifiab|e concentrate is a |iquid , homogeneous formu|ation of the components ( | ) and ( || ) to be app|ied as an emu|sion after di|ution in water. A suspension concentrate is astab|e suspension of the active ingredients in a f|uid intended for di|ution with water before use. A so|ubieconcentrate is a liquid , homogeneous formuIation to be app|ied as a true so|ution of the active ingredients after dilution in water. [ 0031 ] The fungicida| compositions of the present invention can also be formulated as waxes for use as a cover or coating of e. g. fruit , in particu|ar citrus fruit. [ 0032 ] , Biocidal compositions according to the present invention can be of use in post - harvest treatment of fruit , especia||y citrus fruit. m the |atter instance , the fruit wil| be sprayed with or dipped or drenched into a liquid formuIation or the fruit may be coated with a waxy composition. The |atter waxy composition conveniently is prepared by thorough|y mixing a suspension concentrate with a suitable wax. The formu|ations for spray , dip or drench applications may be prepared upon di|ution of a concentrate such as , e. g. an emu|sifiab|e concentrate , a suspension concentrate or a solub|e |iquid , with an aqueous medium. Such concentrate in most instances consists of the active ingredients , a dispersing or suspending agent ( surfactant ) , a thickening agent , a sma|| amount of organic solvent , a wetting agent , optiona||y some anti—freeze agent , and water. WO 2009 / 027473 PCT / EP2008 / 061312. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. [ 0033 ] The biocidal compositions of the present invention can a|so be used for protecting eeed against fungi. To that effect the present fungicida| compositions can be coated on seed , in which case the seed grains are drenched consecutive|y with a |iquid composition of the active ingredients 0r if they are coated with a previous|y. combined composition. The compositions can also be sprayed or atomised onto the. seed using e. g. a spinning disc atomiser. [ 0034 ] The combination of components ( | ) and ( |l ) is preferab|y app|ied in the form of. . compositions wherein both said components are intimately admixed in. order to ensure. simu|taneous administration to the materia|s to be protected. Administration or app|ication of both components ( l ) and ( ll ) can a|so be a "sequentia|—combined" administration or app|ication , i. e. component ( i ) and one or more components ( || ) are administered or app|ied a|ternative|y or sequentially in the same p|ace in such a way that they wi|| necessarily become admixed together at the |ocus to be treated. This wi|| be achieved name|y if sequentia| administration or app|ication takes place within a short period of time e. g. within |ess than 24 hours , ' preferab|y |ess than 12 hours. This 7 a|ternative method can be carried out for instance by using a suitab|e sing|e package comprising at |east one container fi||ed with a formu|ation comprising the active component ( | ) and at |east one container fi||ed with a formu|ation comprising an active component ( || ) . Therefore the present invention a|so encompasses a product containing : . _ - ( a ) a composition comprising component ( l ) ( i. e. imaza|i| ) and. - ( b ) a composition comprising as a component ( l| ) , ( a hydroxypyridone selected from 1—hydroxy—2—pyridinone , cic|opirox , cic|opirox o|amine , piroctone , piroctone o|amine and ri|opirox ) ; as a combination for simu|taneous or sequentia| use , wherein said . compositi0ns ( a ) and ( b ) are in respective proportions to provide a synergistic biocidaeffect.
