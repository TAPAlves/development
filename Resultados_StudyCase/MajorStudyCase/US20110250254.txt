BACKGROUND OF THE 1NVENT1ON. [ 0002 ] Micr0bes , and in particu1ar bacteria , are kn0Wn t0 f0rm bi0ﬁ1ms under c0nditi0ns Where there is a c0mbinati0n 0f bacteria , m0isture , nutrients and a suitab1e surface. Bi0ﬁ1m f0rmati0n and bi0f0u1ing create pr0b1ems and ec0nomic 10sses in d0mestic , industria1 and hea1th ﬁe1ds. Vari0us industria1 pr0cesses and insta11ati0ns may be affected , such as submarine insta11ati0ns and shipping , Vari0us engineering industries , 0i1 pr0cessing and manufacturing , the f00d and beVerage industry , the pharmaceutica1 industry , Water systems , 0001ing t0Wers , heat exchangers , chain 1ubricati0n systems and the 1ike. Bi0ﬁ1ms a1s0 cause pr0b1ems in re1ati0n t0 medica1 deVices and imp1ants and cause Vari0us human and anima1 infecti0ns. It is genera11y necessary t0 use a harsh treatment t0 rem0Ve and ki11 an estab1ished bi0ﬁ1m. The reason f0r this is that bacteria situated in a bi0ﬁ1m structure are pr0tected fr0m estab1ished antibacteria1 treatments. Bi0ﬁ1m f0rmati0n is be1ieVed t0 inV01Ve actiVati0n and / 0r d0Wn regu - 1ati0n 0f a number 0f genes in resp0nse t0 c0mmunicati0n signa11ing m01ecu1es.

[ 0173 ] The effect of ( Z ) - 5 - ( bromomethylene ) thiophen - 2 ( 5H ) - one on AI - 1 and AI - 2 quorum - sensing by bacteria Was tested in a bio1uminescence assay as fo11oWs : . [ 0174 ] lnhibition of quorum sensing Was assessed as the abi1ity of the furanone to reduce bio1uminescence induced by ce11 free bacteria1 cu1ture supernatant containing either AI - 1 or AI - 2 signa1mo1ecu1es. Vibri0 harveyi BB886 Was used as an AI - 1 reporter and Vibri0 harveyi BB170 Was used as reporter of AI - 2 communication. [ 0175 ] As a comparison , the corresponding furanone compound Was a1so tested. It Was found that the thiophenone compound Was considerab1y more effectiVe in inhibiting quorum - sensing by both AI - 1 and AI - 2.
