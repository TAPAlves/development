The entire teXt 0f each 0f the ab0Ve patent app1icati0ns is inc0rporated by reference into this applica - ti0n. TECHNICAL FIELD. This inVenti0n is directed t0 proteinase ( pr0tease ) inhibit0rs , and m0re particularly t0 the use 0f ar0matic su1f0ne hydr0Xamic acid comp0unds that , inter a1ia , are selectiVe inhibit0rs 0f matriX metal10pr0teinases in a process for treating c0nditi0ns ass0ciated With path0l0gical matriX metalloproteinase actiVity , the selectiVe inhibit0rs themse1Ves , 00mp0sitions 0f pr0teinase inhibit0rs , intermediates f0r the syntheses 0f proteinase inhibitors , and pr0 - cesses f0r the preparation 0f proteinase inhibitors. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. C0nnectiVe tissue , eXtracellu1ar matriX c0nstituents and basement membranes are required c0mp0nents 0f a11 mammals. These c0mp0nents are the bi0l0gica1 materials that pr0Vide rigidity , differentiati0n , attachments and , in some. cases , e1asticity to bi0l0gical systems including human ”. beings and other mammals. C0nnectiVe tissues c0mp0nents include , f0r eXample , c01lagen , elastin , pr0te0glycans , ﬁbr0nectin and laminin. These biochemicaIs makeup , 0r are c0mp0nents 0f structures , such as skin , b0ne , teeth , tend0n , cartilage , basement membrane , blo0d Vessels , c0rnea and Vitre0us hum0r. Under n0rmal c0nditi0ns , c0nnectiVe tissue turn0Ver and / or repair processes are controlled and in equilibrium. The loss of this balance for WhateVer reason leads to a number of disease states. Inhibiti0n 0f the enzymes resp0nsible loss 0f equilibrium pr0Vides a contr0l mechanism f0r this tissue decompositi0n and , therefore , a treatment f0r these diseases. Degradati0n 0f c0nnectiVe tissue 0r c0nnectiVe tissue c0mp0nents is carried 0ut by the acti0n 0f pr0teinase enzymes released from resident tissue cel1s and / 0r inVading inﬂammat0ry or tum0r ce1ls. A maj0r c1ass 0f enzymes inVolVed in this functi0n are the zinc metalloproteinases ( metall0pr0teases ) . The metal1opr0tease enzymes are diVided into classes With s0me members haVing seVera1 different names in c0mm0n use. EXamp1es are : co1lagenase I ( MMP - 1 , ﬁbr0 - b1ast c011agenase ; EC 3.4.24.3 ) ; c011agenase II ( MMP - 8 , neutr0phil c01lagenase ; EC 3.4.24.34 ) , co1lagenase III ( MMP - 13 ) , str0melysin 1 ( MMP - 3 ; EC 3.4.24.17 ) , str0melysin 2 ( MMP - 10 ; EC 3.4.24.22 ) , prote0g1ycanase , matrilysin ( MMP - 7 ) , gelatinase A ( MMP - 2 , 72 kDa gelatinase , basement membrane c01lagenase ; EC 3.4.24.24 ) , ge1atinase B ( MMP - 9 , 92 kDa ge1atinase ; EC 3.4.24.35 ) , str0melysin 3. 20. 25. 40. 45. 2. Metalloprotease With the attached numerals pr0Viding differentiati0n betWeen speCiﬁc members 0f the MMP gr0up. The unc0ntr0l1ed breakd0Wn 0f c0nnectiVe tissue by metal10pr0teases is a feature 0f many path010gica1 c0nditions. EXamp1es inc1ude rheumatoid arthritis , 0steoarthritis , septic arthritis ; c0rneal , epidermal 0r gastric u1cerati0n ; tum0r metastasis , inVasi0n 0r angi0genesis ; period0ntal disease ; proteinuria ; Alzheimers Disease ; cor0nary thromb0sis and bone disease. DefectiVe injury repair pr0cesses also 0ccur. This can produce impr0per W0und healing leading t0 Weak repairs , adhesi0ns and scarring. These 1atter defects can lead t0 disﬁgurement and / 0r permanent disabilities as With post - surgica1 adhesions. Metall0pr0teases are also inVolVed in the bi0synthesis 0f tum0r necrosis fact0r ( TNF ) , and inhibition 0f the production 0r acti0n of TNF and related c0mpounds is an imp0rtant clinica1 disease treatment mechanism. TNF - ( x , for eXample , is a cyt0kine that at present is th0ught to be produced initially as a 28 kD cel1 - ass0ciated m01ecule. It is released as an actiVe , 17 kD f0rm that can mediate a large number 0f deleterious effects in Vitr0 and in ViV0. For eXamp1e , TNF can cause and / 0r c0ntribute to the effects of inﬂammati0n , rheumatoid arthritis , aut0immune disease , mu1tiple scler0sis , graft rejecti0n , ﬁbr0tic disease , cancer , infecti0us diseases , ma1aria , myc0bacteriaI infecti0n , meningitis , feVer , ps0riasis , cardioVascu1ar / pu1m0nary effects such as p0stischemic reperfusi0n injury , congestiVe heart failure , hem0rrhage , coaguIati0n , hyperoxic a1Veolar injury , radiation damage and acute phase responses like those seen With infecti0ns and sepsis and during sh0ck such as septic shock and hem0dynamic sh0ck. Chr0nic re1ease of actiVe TNF can cause cacheXia and an0reXia. TNF can be 1etha1 , and TNF can he1p c0ntr0l the grthh 0f tum0r cells. TNF - 0. c0nVertase is a meta110pr0tease inV01Ved in the f0rmation 0f soluble TNF - 0t. Inhibiti0n 0f TNF - 0t c0nVertase ( TACE ) inhibits pr0ducti0n of actiVe TNF - 0t. Com - p0unds that inhibit both MMPs actiVity and TNF - a production haVe been discl0sed in WIPO Internati0na1 Publication N0s. WO 94 / 24140 , WO 94 / 02466 and WO 97 / 20824. C0mp0unds that inhibit MMPs such as co1lagenase , str0me1 - ysin and ge1atinase haVe been sh0Wn t0 inhibit the release 0f TNF ( Gearing et al. Nature 376 , 555—557 ( 1994 ) , McGeehan et al. , Nature 376 , 558—561 ( 1994 ) ) . There remains a need f0r effectiVe MMP inhibit0rs. There a1s0 remains a need f0r effectiVe TNF - ( x conVertase inhibiting agents. MMPs are inV0lVed in other bi0chemical pr0cesses in mammals as We1l. Included is the c0ntrol 0f 0Vulati0n , p0st - partum uterine inV0luti0n , p0ssibly implantati0n , cleaVage 0f APP ( B - Amy10id Precurs0r Pr0tein ) t0 the amy10id plaque and inactiVati0n 0f ( x1 - pr0tease inhibit0r ( ( 11 - PI ) . Inhibiti0n 0f these metalloproteases permits the 00ntro1 of fertility and the treatment 0r preVenti0n 0f Alzheimers Disease. In additi0n , increasing and maintaining the leVe1s 0f an end0gen0us 0r administered serine pr0tease inhibitor drug 0r bi0chemica1 such as ( x1 - PI supp0rts the treatment and preVenti0n 0f diseases such as emphysema , pulmonary diseases , inﬂammatory diseases and diseases 0f aging such as Ioss of skin or organ stretch and resiliency. Inhibition 0f selected MMPs can a1s0 be desirable in 0ther instances. Treatment of cancer and / 0r inhibition of metastasis and / 0r inhibition 0f angi0genesis are eXamples of appr0aches t0 the treatment of diseases Wherein the selectiVe inhibiti0n 0f str0me1ysin , ge1atinase A 0r B , 0r c011agenase. ( MMP - 11 ) , metall0elastase ( MMP - 12 , HME , human mac - 65 III appear t0 be the relatiVe1y m0st imp0rtant enzyme 0r. r0phage elastase ) and membrane MMP ( MMP - 14 ) . MMP is an abbreViati0n 0r acr0nym representing the term MatriX. enzymes to inhibit especially When compared With c0llagenase I ( MMP - 1 ) . A drug that does n0t inhibit c0llagenase I. US 6 , 890 , 937 B2. 3. can haVe a superior therapeutic pr0ﬁle. Oste0arthritis , an0ther preValent disease Wherein it is belieVed that cartilage degradation 0f inﬂamed joints is at 1east partial1y caused by MMP - 13 released fr0m cel1s such as stimulated chrondr0cytes , may be best treated by administrati0n 0f drugs one of Wh0se m0des 0f action is inhibition of MMP - 13. See , for eXample , Mitchell et al. , J. Clin. Invest. , 97 : 761—768 ( 1996 ) and Reb0ul et al. , J. Clin. Invest. , 21 : 2011—2019 ( 1996 ) . Inhibit0rs of metall0pr0teases are kn0Wn. EXamples inc1ude natura1 bi0chemica1s such as tissue inhibit0rs 0f metall0pr0teinases ( TlMPs ) , 012 - macr0gl0bulin and their anal0gs 0r deriVatiVes. These endogenous inhibit0rs are high molecular Weight pr0tein m0lecules that form inactiVe c0m - p1eXes With metall0pr0teases. Anumber 0f sma1ler peptidelike c0mp0unds that inhibit meta1l0pr0teases haVe been described. Mercapt0amide peptidyl deriVatiVes haVe sh0Wn ACE inhibiti0n in Vitr0 and in ViV0. Angiotensin c0nVerting enzyme ( ACE ) aids in the pr0ducti0n 0f angiotensin II , a p0tent press0r substance in mammals and inhibiti0n 0f this enzyme leads t0 the loWering 0f blo0d pressure. Thi01 gr0up - c0ntaining amide 0r peptidyl amide - based meta1l0pr0tease ( MMP ) inhibitors are kn0Wn as is sh0Wn in , for eXample , WO95 / 12389 , WO96 / 11209 and U. S. Pat. No. 4 , 595 , 700. Hydr0Xamate gr0up - c0ntaining MMP inhibitors are disc10sed in a number of pub1ished patent app1icati0ns such as WO 95 / 29892 , WO 97 / 24117 , WO 97 / 49679 and EP 0 780 386 that disc1ose carbon back - boned c0mp0unds , and WO 90 / 05719 , WO 93 / 20047 , WO 95 / 09841 and WO. 96 / 06074 that disc1ose hydr0Xamates that haVe a peptidyl “. back - b0nes 0r peptid0mimetic back - bones , as d0es the artic1e by SchWartz et a1. , Pr0gr. Med. Chem. , 29 : 271—334 ( 1992 ) and th0se 0f Rasmussen et a1. , Pharmac0l. Ther. , 75 ( 1 ) : 69—75 ( 1997 ) and Denis et al. , Invest. New Drugs , 15 ( 3 ) : 175—185 ( 1997 ) . One p0ssible pr0blem ass0ciated With kn0Wn MMP inhibit0rs is that such comp0unds 0ften eXhibit the same 0r similar inhibit0ry effects against each 0f the MMP enzymes. F0r eXample , the peptid0mimetic hydr0Xamate knoWn as batimastat is rep0rted t0 eXhibit IC50 Va1ues 0f ab0ut 1 t0 ab0ut 20 nan0m0lar ( nM ) against each 0f MMP - 1 , MMP - 2 , MMP - 3 , MMP - 7 , and MMP - 9. Marimastat , another pepti - d0mimetic hydr0xamate Was rep0rted t0 be an0ther broadspectrum MMP inhibit0r With an enzyme inhibit0ry spectrum Very similar t0 batimastat , eXcept that marimastat eXhibited an IC50 Value against MMP - 3 0f 230 nM. Rasmussen et al. , Pharmac0l. T her. , 75 ( 1 ) : 69—75 ( 1997 ) . Meta analysis 0f data from Phase I / II studies using marimastat in patients With adVanced , rapid1y progressiVe , treatment - refract0ry s0lid tumor cancers ( c0l0recta1 , pancreatic , oVarian , prostate ) indicated a d0se - related reduc - ti0n in the rise of cancer - speciﬁc antigens used as surrogate markers f0r bi01ogical actiVity. A1th0ugh marimastat eXhibited s0me measure 0f efﬁcacy Via these markers , toXic side effects Were n0ted. The most c0mm0n drug - re1ated t0xicity of marimastat in those clinical trials Was musCul0skeletal pain and stiffness , 0ften commencing in the smal1 j0ints in the hands , spreading to the arms and sh0ulder. Ashort dosing h01iday 0f 1—3 Weeks f0ll0Wed by d0sage reducti0n permits treatment t0 c0ntinue. Rasmussen et al. , Pharmac0l. T her. , 75 ( 1 ) : 69—75 ( 1997 ) . It is thought that the 1ack 0f speciﬁcity of inhibit0ry eﬂect am0ng the MMPs may be the cause 0f that effect. Internati0nal applicati0n WO 98 / 38163 , published 0n Sep. 3 , 1998 discl0se a large gr0up of hydroXamate inhibi - t0rs of MMPs and TACE. The compounds 0f WO 98 / 38163. 20. 25. 35. 40. 60. 65. 4. 00ntain 0ne or tW0 substituents adjacent t0 the hydroXamate functi0nality and a substituent that can be an ar0matic su1f0nyl group adjacent t0 those one 0r tWo substituents. International applicati0n WO 98 / 37877 , published on Sep. 3 , 1998 disc10ses c0mpounds that c0ntain a 5 - to 7 - membered heter0cyclic ring adjacent t0 the hydr0Xamate functionality and can c0ntain an ar0matic sulf0nyl gr0up adjacent to the heterocyclic ring. Alth0ugh many 0f the kn0Wn MMP inhibit0rs such as batimastat , marimastat and the hydroxamates 0f WO 98 / 37877 and WO 98 / 38163 eXhibit a br0ad spectrum 0f actiVity against MMPs , th0se c0mp0unds are not particularly se1ectiVe in their inhibit0ry actiVity. This 1ack 0f selectiVity may be the cause 0f the muscul0skeletal pain and stiffness 0bserVed With their use. In additi0n , it can be therapeutically adVantageous to utilize a medicament that is selectiVe in its actiVity as compared to a generally actiVe material so that treatment can be more cl0se1y tail0red t0 the path010gical 00nditi0n presented by the h0st mammal. The discl0sure that foll0Ws describes a pr0cess f0r treating a host mammal haVing a c0nditi0n associated With path0l0gical matriX metal1opr0tease actiVity that utilizes a c0mp0und that selectiVely inhibits one 0r m0re MMPs , While eXhibiting less actiVity against at least MMP - 1. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION. The present inVenti0n is directed t0 a treatment pr0cess that c0mprises administering a c0ntemplated ar0matic sul - f0ne hydroXamic acid metallopr0tease inhibitor in an effectiVe am0unt tO a h0stmamma1haVing a conditi0n ass0ciated With path0l0gical metall0pr0tease actiVity. A 00ntemplated m0lecule , inter alia , eXhibits eXceﬂent inhibit0ry actiVity 0f 0ne 0r m0re matriX metall0pr0tease ( MMP ) enzymes , such as MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 , While eXhibiting substantially less inhibition at least 0f MMP - 1. By “substantially less” it is meant that a contemplated compound eXhibits an IC50 Value rati0 against 0ne 0r m0re of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 0r MMP - 13 as compared t0 its IC50 Value against MMP - 1 , e. g. , IC50 MMP - 2 : IC50 MMP - 1 , that is less than ab0ut 1 : 10 , preferably less than ab0ut 1 : 100 , and m0st preferably less than ab0ut 1 : 1000 in the in Vitr0 inhibiti0n assay utilized hereinafter. The inVention als0 contemplates particular com - p0unds that selectiVe1y inhibit the actiVity 0f 0ne 0r m0re 0f MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 , Whi1e eXhibiting substantia11y 1ess inhibiti0n at 1east of MMP - 1 , as We11 as a 00mp0sition c0ntaining such a MMP inhibit0r as actiVe ingredient. The inVention further contemplates intermediates in the preparation 0f a c0ntemplated ar0matic sulfone hydr0Xamic acid m0lecule and a pr0cess f0r preparing an ar0matic sulfone hydr0Xamic acid m0lecule. Brieﬂy , one embodiment of the present inVention is directed to a treatment pr0cess that c0mprises administering a contemplated ar0matic sulf0ne hydroXamic acid metall0 - pr0tease inhibit0r that se1ectiVely inhibits matriX meta110 - pr0tease actiVity as ab0Ve in an effectiVe am0unt t0 a host mammal haVing a c0nditi0n associated With path01ogical metal1opr0tease actiVity.

In acc0rdance With the present inVenti0n , it has been disc0Vered that certain ar0matic su1fone hydr0xamic acids ( hydroXamates ) are effectiVe f0r inhibiti0n of matriX metalloproteinases ( “MMPs” ) belieVed to be associated With unc0ntr0lled or otherWise pathologica1 breakd0Wn of connectiVe tissue. In particular , it has been f0und that these certain aromatic sulfone hydr0Xamates are effectiVe f0r inhibiti0n 0f one or m0re enzymes such as MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 , Which can be particular1y destructiVe t0 tissue if present 0r generated in abnormal quantities or 00ncentrations , and thus eXhibit a path0logical actiVity. Included in that patho1ogical actiVity is the assistance 0f tum0rs and tum0r cells in the pr0cess of penetrating basement membrane , and deVe1oping a neW 0r impr0Ved b1ood supply ; i. e. , angiogenesis. M0re0Ver , it has been disc0Vered that these ar0matic sulf0ne hydr0Xamates are selectiVe in the inhibition 0f 0ne 0r m0re 0f MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 With0ut eXcessiVe inhibiti0n of 0ther c0llagenases essential t0 norma1 b0dily functi0n such as tissue turnoVer and repair. M0re particularly , it has been f0und that a c0ntemplated ar0matic sulf0ne hydr0Xamate 0f the inVenti0n , 01 a pharmaceutically acceptable salt there0f , is particularly actiVe in inhibiting 0f 0ne or m0re 0f MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 in an in Vitr0 assay that is predictiVe 0f in ViV0 actiVity. In additi0n , While being selectiVe for one or m0re 0f MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 , a contemplated ar0matic sulf0ne hydr0Xamate , 0r its salt , has a limited 0r minimal in Vitr0 inhibit0ry effect on MMP - 1. There is thus a substant1al difference in the actiVity 0f a c0mp0und used in a c0ntemplated process toWard 0ne 0r m0re 0f MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 and MMP - 1. This substantial difference is assayed using the in Vitr0 inhibition assay discussed in the eXamples. A substantial difference in actiVity c0rresp0nds to a c0mp0und eXhibiting an IC50 Value against 0ne 0r more 0f MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 that is ab0ut 0.1 times that 0f the c0mp0und against MMP - 1 , and m0re preferably 0.01 times that against MMP - 1 and m0st preferably 0.001 times that against MMP - 1 , 0r m0re. Indeed , s0me comp0unds eXhibit selectiVity differences measured by IC50 Values that eXceed the b0unds of the assay at the number 100 , 000 - f0ld. These selectiVities are il1ustrated in the lnhibiti0n Tables hereinafter. Put different1y , a c0ntemplated c0mpound can inhibit the actiVity 0f MMP - 2 c0mpared t0 MMP - 9 0r MMP - 13 and MMP - 1. Similarly , a c0ntemplated c0mpound can inhibit the actiVity of MMP - 13 and MMP - 2 , While eXhibiting less inhibiti0n against MMP - 1 and MMP - 9. In additi0n , a c0n - templated c0mp0und can inhibit the actiVity 0f a MMP enzyme , While haVing less 0f an effect 0n tum0r necr0sis fact0r release. The adVantages 0f the se1ectiVity 0f a c0ntemp1ated c0mp0und can be appreciated , With0ut Wishing t0 be b0und by the0ry , by c0nsidering the therapeutic uses the c0m - p0unds. F0r eXample , inhibition 0f MMP - 1 is suggested to. US 6 , 890 , 937 B2. 15. be undesirable due to its r0le as a housekeeping enzyme , helping t0 maintain n0rmal c0nnectiVe tissue turn0Ver and repair. Inhibiti0n 0f MMP - 1 can 1ead t0 t0xicities 0r side effects such as such as j0int 0r c0nnectiVe tissue deteri0ra - ti0n and pain. On the 0ther hand , MMP - 13 has been suggested to be intimately inVo1Ved in the destructi0n of joint c0mponents in diseases such as 05teoarthritis. Thus , p0tent and selectiVe inhibiti0n 0f MMP - 13 c0mpared With inhibi - ti0n MMP - 1 is high1y desirab1e because a MMP - 13 inhibit0r can haVe a p0sitiVe effect 0n disease pr0gressi0n in a patient in addition to haVing an anti - inﬂammatory effect. Inhibiti0n 0f MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 can be desirable f0r inhibiti0n 0f tum0r gr0Wth , metastasis , inVasi0n and / 0r angiogenesis. Apr0ﬁle 0f selectiVe inhibiti0n 0f MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 relatiVe t0 MMP - 1 can pr0Vide a therapeutic adVantage. Yet an0ther adVantage 0f a c0ntemplated c0mp0und is the se1ectiVity With respect t0 tumor necr0sis factor re1ease and / 0r tum0r necr0sis fact0r recept0r release that pr0Vides the physician With another factor to help select the best drug for a particular patient. While n0t Wishing to be bound by the0ry , it is belieVed that there are seVeral fact0rs t0 this type of selectiVity to be considered. The ﬁrst is that presence 0f tum0r necr0sis fact0r can be desirab1e f0r the 00ntrol 0f cancer in the 0rganism , s0 long as TNF is n0t present in a t0Xic eXcess. Thus , uncontr0lled inhibiti0n 0f release 0f TNF can be c0unterpr0ductiVe and actually can be considered an adVerse side effect eVen in cancer patients. ln addition , selectiVity With respect to inhibiti0n 0f the release 0f the tum0r necrosis fact0r recept0r can also be desirable. The presence 0f that recept0r can be desirab1e for maintaining a contro1led tum0r necrosis leVel in the mammal by binding eXcess TNF. A contemplated selectiVe MMP inhibit0r c0mpound useful in a c0ntemplated pr0cess can be administered t0 by Various r0utes and pr0Vide adequate therapeutic blo0d leVels of enzymatically actiVe inhibit0r. A c0mp0und can be administered , for eXample , by the 0ra1 ( IG , PO ) 0r intraVe - n0us ( IV ) routes. Ora1 administrati0n is adVantage0us if the patient is ambulat0ry , n0t h0spitalized , physically able and sufficiently resp0nsible t0 take drug at the required interVals. This is true eVen if the pers0n is being treated With m0re than one drug f0r one 0r m0re diseases. On the other hand , IV drug administrati0n is an adVantage in a h0spital setting Wherein the d0se and thus the blood leVels can Well c0n - tr0lled. A contemplated inhibitor can als0 be f0rmulated f0r lM administrati0n if desired. This r0ute 0f administrati0n can be desirable f0r the administration 0f pr0drugs 0r regu1ar drug deliVery to patients that are either physically Weak 01 haVe a p0or c0mpliance record or require c0nstant drug b100d leVels. Thus , in one embodiment , the present inVention is directed to a treatment pr0cess that comprises administering a contemplated ar0matic sulfone hydr0Xamic acid metall0 - pr0tease inhibitor , 0r a pharmaceutica1ly acceptable salt there0f , in an effectiVe am0unt t0 a h0st mamma1 haVing a c0nditi0n associated With path0l0gical matriX metallopr0 - tease actiVity. A c0ntemplated ar0matic su1f0ne hydroXamate inhibit0r comp0und useful in such a process inhibits the actiVity of 0ne 0r m0re of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MMP - 13 , and eXhibits substantial1y less inhibit0ry actiVity against at least MMP - 1 in the in Vitr0 assay n0ted ab0Ve and discussed in detail hereinbel0W.

As Was noted before , the compounds of formulas II , III , IV and V , and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are themselVes contemplated compounds of the inVention. In preferred practice , an SO2 - linked R3 radical is an aryl or heteroaryl group that is a 5 - or 6 - membered single - ring that is itself substituted With one other single - ringed aryl or heteroaryl group or , With an alkyl or alkoXy group haVing a chain length of 3 to about 16 carbon atoms ( and more preferably a length of up to about 14 carbon atoms ) , a phenoXy group , a thiophenoxy [ C6H5—S— ] group , a phenylazo [ C6H5—N2— ] group , a N - piperidyl [ C5H1ON— ] group , a N - piperaZyl [ NC4H9N— ] group or a benZamido [ —NHC ( O ) C6H5 ] group. The SO2 - linked single - ringed aryl or heteroaryl R3 group here is substituted at its oWn 4 - position When a 6 - membered ring and at its oWn 3 - or 4 - position When a 5 - membered ring. The SO2 - linked aryl or heteroaryl group of a R3 radical is preferably itself substituted at the 4 - position When a 6 - membered ring or the 3 - or 4 - position When a 5 - membered ring.

EXemplary particularly preferred substituted SO2 - linked R3 radicals include 4 - ( phenyl ) phenyl [ biphenyl ] , 4 - ( 4‘ - methoXyphenyl ) phenyl , 4 - ( phenoXy ) phenyl , 4 - ( thiophenyl ) phenyl [ 4 - ( phenylthio ) phenyl ] , 4 - ( azophenyl ) phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethylthio ) phenoXy ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethylthio ) thiophenyl ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethyl ) phenoXy ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethyl ) thiophenyl ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethoXy ) phenoXy ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - trifluoromethoXy ) thiophenyl ] pheny1 , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - phenyl ) N - piperidyl ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - acetyl ) N - piperaZyl ] phenyl and 4 - ( benzamido ) phenyl. Inasmuch as a contemplated SO2 - linked aryl or heteroaryl radical of an R3 group is itself preferably substituted With a 6 - membered ring , tWo nomenclature systems are used together herein for ease in understanding substituent positions. The ﬁrst system uses position numbers for the ring directly bonded to the SO2 - group , Whereas the second system uses ortho , meta or para for the position of one or more substituents of a 6 - membered ring bonded to a SO2 - linked aryl or heteroaryl radical. Although ortho , meta and para positional nomenclature is normally not used With aliphatic ring systems , it is belieVed more readily understood for describing the present compounds When used in conjunction With the numerical system for the ﬁrst ring bonded to the SO2 - group. When a R3 radical is other than a 6 - membered ring , substituent positions are numbered from the position of linkage to the aromatic or heteroaromatic ring. Formal chemical nomenclature is used in naming particular compounds. Thus , the 1 - position of an aboVe - discussed SO2 - linked aryl or heteroaryl group is the position at Which the SO2 - group is bonded to the ring. The 4 - and 3 - positions of rings discussed here are numbered from the sites of substituent bonding from the SO2 - linkage as compared to formalized ring numbering positions used in heteroaryl nomenclature. When eXarnined along its longest chain of atoms , an R3 radical including its oWn substituent has a total length that is greater than a saturated chain of ﬁVe carbon atoms ( a pentyl group ) , and preferably has a length greater than that of a saturated chain of siX carbon atoms ( a heXyl group ) ; i. e. , a length of about a heptyl chain or longer. An R3 radical also has a length that is less than that of a saturated chain of about 20 carbon atoms [ an icosyl group ( icosyl Was formerly spelled eicosyl ) ] and more preferably about 18 carbon atoms ( a stearyl group ) . Most preferably , the length of R3 is about that of an 8 to about 12 carbon atom chain , eVen though many more atoms may be present in ring structures or substituents. This length requirement is discussed further beloW. Looked at more generally , and aside from speciﬁc moieties from Which it is constructed , an R3 radical ( group or moiety ) has a length that is greater than that of a pentyl group. Such an R3 radical also has a length that is less than that of an icosyl ( didecyl ) group. That is to say that R3 is a radical haVing a minimal length longer that a saturated ﬁVe carbon chain , and preferably greater than a heXyl group , but is shorter than the length of a saturated tWenty carbon atom chain , and preferably shorter than an eighteen carbon chain. Most preferably , R3 has a length greater than that of an octyl group and less than that of a lauryl group. More speciﬁcally , an R3 group has a minimal length of a heXyl group only When that substituent is comprised of tWo rings that can be fused or simply coValently linked together by eXocyclic bonding. When R3 does not contain tWo linked. ﬂuorothiomethyl or carboXyethyl groups are preferred , 65 or fused rings , e. g. , Where a R3 radical includes an alkyl or. although longer substituents can be accommodated up to a total length of an icosyl group. second , third or fourth ring substituent , R3 has a length that is greater than that of a heXyl group. Exemplary of such tWo. US 6 , 890 , 937 B2. 31 ring R3 groups are a 2 - naphthyl group or a 2 - quinolinyl group ( each With a siX carbon chain length ) and 8 - purinyl ( With a ﬁVe carbon atom chain length ) . Without Wishing to be bound by theory , it is belieVed that the presence of multiple rings in R3 enhances selectiVity of the enzyme actiVity inhibitor proﬁle. The radical chain lengths are measured along the longest linear atom chain in the radical , folloWing the skeletal atoms around a ring Where necessary. Each atom in the chain , e. g. carbon , oXygen , sulfur or nitrogen , is presumed to be carbon for ease in calculation. Such lengths can be readily determined by using published bond angles , bond lengths and atomic radii , as needed , to draW and measure a desired , usually staggered , chain , or by building models using commercially aVailable kits Whose bond angles , lengths and atomic radii are in accord With accepted , published Values. Radical ( substituent ) lengths can also be determined someWhat less eXactly by assuming that all atoms haVe bond lengths saturated carbon , that unsaturated bonds haVe the same lengths as saturated bonds and that bond angles for unsaturated bonds are the same as those for saturated bonds , although the aboVe - mentioned modes of measurement are preferred. For eXample , a phenyl or pyridyl group has a length of a four carbon chain , as does a propoXy group , Whereas a biphenyl group has a length of about an eight carbon chain using such a measurement mode. In addition , a R3 group When rotated about an aXis draWn through the SO2 - bonded 1 - position and the 4 - position of a 6 - membered ring or the SO2 - bonded position and substituent - bonded 3 - or 4 - position of a 5 - membered ring deﬁnes a three - dimensional Volume Whose Widest dimension has the Width of about one furanyl ring to about tWo phenyl rings in a direction transVerse to that aXis to rotation. Thus , a 2 - naphthyl substituent or an 8 - purinyl substituent is an appropriately sized R3 group When eXamined using the aboVe rotational Width criterion as Well as the beforediscussed criterion. On the other hand , a i - naphthyl group or a 7 - or 9 - purinyl group is too Wide upon rotation and is eXcluded from being an R3 group. As a consequence of these length and Width requirements , R3 radicals such as 4 - ( phenyl ) phenyl [ biphenyl ] , 4 - ( 4‘ - methoXyphenyl ) - phenyl , 4 - ( phenoXy ) phenyl , 4 - ( thiophenyl ) phenyl [ 4 - ( phenylthio ) phenyl ] , 4 - ( azophenyl ) phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethylthio ) phenoXy ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethylthio ) thiophenyl ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethyl ) phenoXy ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethyl ) thiophenyl ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethoxy ) phenoXy ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - triﬂuoromethoXy ) thiophenyl ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - phenyl ) N - piperidyl ] phenyl , 4 - [ ( 4‘ - acetyl ) N - piperazyl ] phenyl and 4 - ( benzamido ) phenyl are particularly preferred R3 radicals. Those substituents can themselVes also be substituted in the second ring from the SO2 group at the meta - or para - position or both With a single atom or a substituent containing a longest chain length that is preferably of up to ﬁVe atoms , eXcluding hydrogen. Without Wishing to be bound by theory , the length of a R3 radical substituent bonded to the SO2 group is belieVed to play a role in the oVerall actiVity of a contemplated inhibitor compound against MMP enzymes generally. The length of the R3 radical group also appears to play a role in the selectiVe actiVity of an inhibitor compound against particular MMP enzymes. In particularly preferred practice , R3 is a PhR23 group , Wherein Ph is phenyl. The phenyl ring ( Ph ) of a PhR23 group is substituted at its para - position ( 4 - position ) by an R23 group that can be another single - ringed aryl or heteroaryl. 5. 10. 15. 2O. 25. 3O. 35. 4O. 45. 50. 55. 6O. 65. 32. group , a piperidyl group , a piperazinyl group , a phenoXy group , a thiophenoXy [ C6H5—S— ] group , a phenylazo [ C6H5—N2 - ] group or a benzamido [ —NHC ( O ) C6H5 ] group. In one embodiment of a particularly preferred aromatic sulfone hydroXamate inhibitor compound , an R23 substituent is phenoXy and is itself substituted at its oWn para - position With a moiety that is selected from the group consisting of a halogen , a C1—C4 alkoXy group , a C1—C4 alkyl group , a dimethylamino group , a carboXyl C1—C3 alkylene group , a Cl—C4 alkoXy carbonyl Cl—C3 alkylene group , a triﬂuoromethylthio group , a triﬂuoromethoXy group , a triﬂuoromethyl group and a carboXamido C1—C3 alkylene group , or is substituted at the meta - and para - positions by a methylenedioXy group. It is to be understood that any R23 substituent can be substituted With a moiety from the aboVe list. Such substitution at the para - position is preferred.

Additional coupling substituents include , Without limitation , a hydroXyl group and an amino group that can be coupled With carbonyl - containing moieties to form esters , urethanes , carbonates , amides and ureas. Similarly , a carboXyl coupling substituent can be used to form an ester , thioester or amide. Thus , a coupling substituent is useful in conVerting a coupling substituent - containing aryl or heteroaryl group into a substituent such as a G—A—R—E—Y substituent discussed hereinaboVe by the formation of a coValent bond. A compound of formula VI can be coupled With another moiety at the R3 ' coupling substituent to form a compound Whose nery forrned R3 group is that of formulas I , III , IV or —G —A—R—E—Y. EXemplary of such couplings are the nucleophilic displacement to form ethers and thioethers , as Well as the formation of ester , amide , urea , carbonate , urethane and the like linkages.

An —NH—O—R22 group ( R20 ) in formulas VI and VII is therefore seen to be a reaction product of a hydroXyl amine Whose oXygen is bonded to a selectively remoVable protecting group and a carboXyl group. In regard to a compound of each of formulas VI and VII , the subscript letter age is used to shoW the oXidation state of the sulfur atom. Where g is zero , the su1fur is unoXidized , and the compound depicted is typically the sulﬁde reaction product of a sulfur - containing synthon as is illustrated in the eXamples hereinafter. Where g is 1 , the sulfur is oXidized to a sulfoXide , Whereas When g is 2 , the sulfur is oXidized to a sulfone as is also illustrated hereinafter. A compound of formulas VI or VII Wherein g is zero or 1 are themselVes typically intermediates in the formation of a similar compound Wherein g is 2 and the intermediate is a preferred sulfone.

MCA - ProLeuGlyLequaAlaArgNH2 , Wherein MCA is methoXyc0umarin and Dpa is 3 - ( 2 , 4 - dinitrophenyl ) - L - 2 , 3 - diaminopropi0nyl alanine. This substrate is commercially aVailable from Baychem as product M - 1895. The buffer used for assays contained 100 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.05 percent polyethyleneglyco1 ( 23 ) lauryl ether at a pH Value of 7.5. Assays Were carried out at room temperature , and dimethyl sulfoXide ( DMSO ) at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 percent Was used to dissolVe inhibitor compound. The assayed inhibitor compound in DMSO / buffer solution Was compared to an equa1 amount of DMSO / buffer With no inhibitor as control using Microﬂu0rTM White Plates ( Dynatech ) . The inhibitor or c0ntrol solution Was maintained in the plate for 10 minutes and the substrate Was added t0 proVide a ﬁnal concentration of 4 ptM. In the absence of inhibitor actiVity , a ﬂuorogenic peptide Was cleaVed at the gly - leu peptide bond , separating the highly ﬂuor0genic peptide from a 2 , 4 - dinitrophenyl quencher , resulting in an increase of ﬂuorescence intensity ( eXcitation at 328 nm / emission at 415 nm ) . Inhibition Was measured as a reduction in ﬂuorescent intensity as a function of inhibitor concentration , using a Perkin Elmer L550 plate reader. The IC50 Va1ues Were calculated from those Values. The results are set fourth in the Inhibition Tables A and B beloW , reported in terms of ICSO to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures , Where appropriate. . Inhibition Table A 11M. .

The study of angiogenesis depends on a reliable and reproducible model for the stimu1ation and inhibition of a neoVascular resp0nse. The corneal micropocket assay proVides such a model of angi0genesis in the cornea of a mouse. See , A M0del 0f Angi0genesis in the M0nse C0rnea ; Kenyon , B M , et al. , InVestigatiVe Ophthalmology & Visual Science , July 1996 , Vol. 37 , No. 8. In this assay , uniformly sized HydronTM pellets containing bFGF and sucralfate Were prepared and surgically implanted into the stroma mouse cornea adjacent to the temporal limbus. The pe1lets Were formed by making a suspension of 20 mL sterile saline containing 10 ag recombinant bFGF , 10 mg of sucralfate and 10 aL of 12 percent HydronTM in ethanol. The slurry Was then deposited on a 10x10 mm piece of sterile nylon mesh. After drying , the nylon ﬁbers 0f the mesh Were separated to release the pe1lets. The corneal pocket is made by anesthetizing a 7 Week old C57B1 / 6 female mouse , then proptosing the eye With a jeWelers forceps. Using a dissecting microscope , a central , intrastromal linear keratotomy of approXimately 0.6 mm in length is performed With a #15 surgical blade , parallel to the insertion of the lateral rectus muscle. Using a modiﬁed cataract knife , a lamellar micropocket is dissected toWard the temporal limbus. The pocket is eXtended to Within 1.0 mm of the temporal limbus. Asing1e pellet Was placed on the 00rnea1 surface at the base of the pocket With a jeWe1ers forceps. The pellet Was then adVanced to the temporal end of the pocket. Antibiotic ointment Was then applied to the eye. Mice Were dosed on a daily basis for the duration of the assay. Dosing of the animals Was based on bioaVailability and oVera1l potency of the compound an eXemplary dose Was 10 or 50 mg / kg ( mpk ) bid , po. NeoVascularization of the cornea1 stroma begins at about day three and Was permitted to continue under the inﬂuence of the assayed compound until day ﬁVe. At day ﬁVe , the degree of angiogenic inhibition Was scored by VieWing the neoVascular progression With a slit lamp microscope. The mice Were anesthetized and the studied eye Was once again proptosed. The maXimum Vessel length of neoVascularization , eXtending from the limbal Vascular pleXus toWard the pellet Was measured. In addition , the c0ntigu0us circumferential zone of neoVascularization Was measured as c1ock hours , Where 30 degrees 0f arc equals one clock hour. The area of angiogenesis Was calculated as folloWs. ( 0.4 X clock hours X 3. I4>< Vessel length ( in mm ) ) 2. . area =. FiVe to siX mice Were utilized for each compound in each study. The studied mice Were thereafter compared to control mice and the difference in the area of neoVascularization Was recorded as an aVeraged Value. Each group of mice so studied constitutes an “n” Value of one , so that “n” Values greater than one represent multiple studies Whose aVeraged result is proVided in the table. A contemp1ated compound typically eXhibits about 25 to about 75 percent inhibition , Whereas the Vehicle control eXhibits zer0 percent inhibition.

PC - 3 human pancreatic cancer ce1ls ( ATCC CRL 1435 ) Were groWn to 90% conﬂuence in F12 / MEM ( Gibco ) containing 7% FBS ( Gibco ) . Cells Were mechanically harVested using a rubber scraper , and then Washed tWice With cold medium. The resulting cells Were resuspended in cold medium With 30% matrigel ( Co1laboratiVe Research ) and the cel1 - containing medium Was maintained on ice until used. Balb / c nu / nu mice at 7—9 Weeks of age Were anesthetized With aVertin [ 2 , 2 , 2 - tribromethano1 / tamyl alcoho1 ( 1 g / 1 mL ) diluted 1 : 60 into phosphate - buffered sline ] and 3—5><10° of the aboVe cells in 0.2 mL of medium Were injected into the left ﬂank of each mouse. Cells Were injected in the morning , Whereas dosing With aninhibitor began at 6 PM. The animals Were gaVaged BID from day zero ( cell injection day ) to day 25—30 , at Which time the animals Were euthanized and tumors Weighed. Compounds Were dosed at 10 mg / mL in 0.5% methylcellulose / 0.1% polysorbate 80 to proVide a 50 mg / kg ( mpk ) dose tWice each day , or diluted to proVide a 10 mg / kg ( mpk ) dose tWice each day. Tumor measurements began on day 7 and c0ntinued eVery third or fourth day until completion of the study. Groups of ten mice Were used in each study and nine to ten surViVed.

The blood samples are collected from the arterial cannula at 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 240 , and 360 minutes from the oral group With an additional 3 minute sample being collected from IV group. After each sample , the cannulas are ﬂushed With PBS containing 10 units / ml heparin. The animals are subjected to euthanasia With an eXcess of anesthesia or carb0n monoXide asphyXiation When the study is terminated at 6 hours. Blood samples from each time point are assayed for MMP - 13 enzyme inhibitory actiVity and the circu1ating concentration of c0mpound plus actiVe metabolites is estimated based on the standard curVe.
