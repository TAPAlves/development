The present invention re|ates to a method of treating patients who undergo hematopoietic stem ce|| transp|antation ( HSCT ) with periphera| b|ood mobi|ized stem ce||s for hemato|ogica| ma|ignancies and for whom the risk for severe acute graft. versus host disease ( GVHD ) is considerab|e. BACKGROUND. Acute graft - versus - host disease ( GVHD ) may occur after a||ogeneic hematopoietic stem ce|| transp|ant and is usua||y a reaction ofdonor immune ce||s against host tissues. Activated donor T ce||s typica||y damage host epithe|ia| ce||s after an inf|ammatory cascade that begins with the preparative regimen. Statistica||y , about 35%—50% of hematopoietic stem ce|| transp|ant ( HSCT ) recipients / patients may deve|op acute GVHD. The exact risk is usua||y dependent on the stem ce|| source , age ofthe patient , conditioning , and GVHD prophy|axis / treatment used. Patients usua||y may have invo|vement ofthree organs such as skin ( rash / dermatitis ) , |iver ( hepatitis / jaundice ) , and gastrointestina| tract ( abdominapain / diarrhea ) . Acute GVHD is typica||y staged and graded ( grade 0 - |V ) by the number and extent of organ invo|vement. Patients with grade ||| / |V acute GVHD tend to have a poor outcome ( |ife threatening ) . Genera||y a patient may be treated by optimizing the immunosuppression and for examp|e by adding methy|predniso|one. About 50% of patients may have a so|id response to methy|predniso|one. |f patients progress after 3 days or are not improved after 7 days , they wi|| get sa|vage ( second - |ine ) immunosuppressive therapy for which there is unfortunate|y no standard - of - care. therapy. Therefore there is a high unmet medica| need to have further pharmaceutica||y. effective drugs for preventing and / or treating GVHD. m an embodiment the present invention re|ates to a method of treating and / or preventing GVHD in a patient undergoing HSCT , which method comprises : 1.

WO 2014 / 128611 PCT / IB2014 / 059067. 13. D : Transp|anation ( infusion of stem ce||s ) , i. e. HSCT wi|| be performed on Day 11. Standard activities , in addition to the investigative treatment may inc|ude standard GVHD prophy|axis , pre and post transp|ant supportive care and fo||ow - up. assessments according to the institutiona| practices. 2. Treatment Arms. Patients wi|| be assigned to the fo||owing treatment : . Sing|e arm : 2 - amino - 2 - [ 4 - ( 3 - benzy|oxypheny|thio ) - 2 - ch|oropheny| ] ethy| - propane - 1 , 3 - dio| , 3mg once dai|y for 111 days. 3. Treatment assignment.

This is an open - |abe| study and a|| subjects wi|| receive the same treatment. 5. Subject screening numbering. Each subject screened is assigned a unique screening number. 6. Dispensing the study treatment. Appropriate documentation of the subject specific dispensing process must be maintained. The study drug for the subjects wi|| be dispensed and supp|ied by the sponsor of the study. Medication |abe|s wi|| comp|y with |ega| requirements of the country where the study is performed and be printed in the |oca| |anguage. Storage. conditions for the study drug wi|| be inc|uded on the medication |abe|. 7. |nstructions for prescribing and taking study treatment. During the hospita|ization period study medication wi|| be administered by the study center personne| with approximate|y 180 - 240 m| of water. The dispensation of the study medication must be carefu||y supervised and contro||ed. A|| dosages prescribed and dispensed to the subject and a|| dose changes during the study must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record CRF ( CRF = company for c|inica|. readout assessment ) . 8. Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment Study drug dose adjustments may be permitted and drug interruptions wi|| be a||owed. based on the judgment of the |nvestigator. Conditions / events that may |ead to the. WO 2014 / 128611 PCT / IB2014 / 059067. 14. study drug interruptions based on investigatorjudgment and overa|| c|inicaassessment inc|ude : . - reported serious adverse event. - emergency medica| condition with or without invo|ving use of exc|uded concomitant medications. - c|inica||y significant |aboratory va|ue ( s ) or abnorma| test or examination resu|t ( s ) . - patients non - comp|iance. |n order to avoid a negative impact of study drug discontinuation and re - start on patient‘s safety , a discussion between the investigator and sponsor wi|| take p|ace on a case by case basis. This is to decide whether or not to continue treatment considering the reason for , timing and duration of discontinuation. This is a|so to determine whether additiona| safety measures are required or not when re - starting study drug , e. g. if the interruption was |ong enough to warrant cardiac monitoring. |n case of notab|e adverse events , safety concerns and / or based on pharmacokinetic data during the study , administration of a dose be|ow the p|anned dose , i. e. 3 mg per day may be considered. For patients who are unab|e to to|erate the protoco| - specified dosing scheme , dose adjustments and interruptions are permitted in order to keep the patient on study drug. These changes must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record CRF. Concomitant treatment. A|| prescription medications , over - the - counter drugs and signiﬁcant non - drug therapies. ( inc|uding physica| therapy and b|ood transfusions ) administered ortaken within the timeframe deﬁned in the entry criteria priorto the start of the study and during the study , must be recorded on the Concomitant medications / Significant non - drug therapies section of the CRF. Medication entries shou|d be specific to trade name , the sing|e dose and unit , the frequency and route of administration , the start and discontinuation date and the reason for therapy. Current|y , there is no uniform protoco| for the use of conditioning , GVHD propy|axis , HSCT and overa|| peritransp|ant care , any or a|| of which may vary significant|y across different sites and may a|so vary patient by patient at the same site. Therefore , such concomitant. treatments wi|| be used according to institutiona| practices. The fo||owing concomitant treatment ( s ) is ( are ) typica||y avai|ab|e in the event of a. need : .

This Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may be administered to patients as standard of care. |n order to mitigate the risk for potentia| drug - drug interactions with the treatment drug , PK samp|es wi|| be ana|yzed. on an ongoing basis. Conditioning of a Patient Reduced |ntensity Conditioning : As an examp|e , Mini - Seatt|e Conditioning with F|udarabin wi|| be used at 30. mg / m2 / day for three days fo||owed by tota| body irradiation ( TB| ) ( 1x 200cGy / day ) . Mye|oab|ative Conditioning. High dose chemotherapy and tota| body irradiation ( TB| ) wi|| be performed according to nationa| guideines adapted to institutiona| practices , and may inc|ude the use of ﬁudarabin , busu|phan , methotrexate , cyc|osporin A and cyc|ophosphamide.

Usua||y , a compound of formu|a ( | ) wi|| be given as an add - on - treatment to the norma| treatment drug given to patients to prevent GVHD. The standard of care for prophy|axis of GVHD has many side effects and in a high percentage of patients. does not prevent GVHD. According|y , patients may receive prophy|axis as per institutiona| practices using for examp|e cyc|osporin A ( CsA ) , mycopheno|ate or methotrexate. As an examp|e , . patients begin CsA on Day 8 ( day - 3 re|ative to HSCT ) at an initia| dose of2.5 mg / kg. WO 2014 / 128611 PCT / IB2014 / 059067. 16. N over 2 hours every 12 hours. Dose adjustments may be made on the basis of toxicity and CsA |eve|s with a targeted trough |eve| of 150 - 400 mg / L. Once a patient can to|erate ora| medications , CsA is typica||y converted to an per ora| ( p. o. ) form. |nitia| p. o. dosing might be the current intra venious ( i. v. ) dose given twice dai|y. CsA dosing is typica||y monitored at |east week|y and may be a|tered as c|inica||y appropriate. Methotrexate schedu|e and dosing may be adapted according to interna| standards ofan institution ( e. g. 10mg / kg on Day 11 , 6mg / kg on Day 13 and on Day 16 ) . Mycopheno|ate may typica||y be given according to the institutiona| practices ( e. g. 2x100mg per day after mini - Seatt|e conditioning ) . Dose adjustments may be made. based on c|inica| side effects. Hematopoetic stem ce|| transp|ant ( HSCT ) . Periphera| mobi|ized stem ce|| wi|| be used according to institutiona| practices.
