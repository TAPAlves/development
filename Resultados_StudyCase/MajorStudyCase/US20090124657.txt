[ 0001 ] The present inVenti0n re1ates t0 pharmaceutica1 c0mp0siti0ns 00mpri sing m0nte1ukast , inc1uding 0r pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e sa1ts , s01Vates , p01ym0rphs , enanti - 0mers 0r mixtures there0f. The inVenti0n a1s0 re1ates t0 pr0 - cesses f0r preparing the 00mp0siti0ns and their meth0ds 0f use. [ 0002 ] M0nte1ukast is described chemica11y as [ R - ( E ) ] - 1 - [ [ [ 1 - [ 3 - [ 2 - ( 7 - ch10r0 - 2 - quin01iny1 ) etheny1 ] pheny1 ] - 3 - [ 2 - ( 1 - hydr0xy - 1 - methy1ethy1 ) pheny1 ] pr0py1 ] thi0 ] methy1 ] cyc10 - pr0paneacetic acid ( hereinafter referred t0 by its ad0pted name “m0nte1ukast” ) and is structura1ly represented by F0r - mula I. The pharmac0l0gica11y actiVe enanti0mer 0f racemic m0ntelukast is the R - enanti0mer. F0rmula I. . [ 0003 ] The sOdium salt , called m0nte1ukast s0dium , is a hygr0sc0pic , 0ptically actiVe , and White t0 0ff - White p0Wder. The empirica1 f0rmu1a f0r the c0mp0und is C35H35C1NNaO3S , and its m01ecu1ar weight is 608.18. M0n - te1ukast sodium is freer solubIe in ethan0I , methan0I and Water and practically ins0luble in acet0nitrile. [ 0004 ] M0ntelukast is a selectiVe and 0rally actiVe 1euk0t - riene recept0r antag0nist that inhibits the cysteiny1 1euk0t - riene CysLT 1 recept0r and is usefu1 in the treatment 0f asthma as We11 as 0ther c0nditi0ns mediated by 1euk0trienes , such as inﬁammati0n and allergies. [ 0005 ] M0ntelukast s0dium is marketed in the f0rm 0f ﬁlm c0ated tab1ets ( 10.4 mg m0nte1ukast s0dium , 10 mg m0n - te1ukast equiVa1ent ) , cheWing tab1ets ( 4 and 5 mg m0nte1ukast equiVa1ent ) , and 0ra1 granuIes ( 5 mg m0nte1ukast equiVa1ent ) , as SINGULAIR®. [ 0006 ] It has been rep0rted that m0nte1ukast s0dium ( SINGULAIR® ) is indicated f0r the pr0phy1aXis and chr0nic treatment 0f asthma in adu1ts and pediatric patients 12 m0nths 0f age and 01der and f0r the re1ief 0f sympt0ms 0f a11ergic rhinitis ( seas0na1 aI1ergic rhinitis in adults and pediatric patients 2 years 0f age and 01der , and perennia1 a11ergic rhinitis in adu1ts and pediatric patients 6 m0nths and 01der ) . [ 0007 ] M0nte1ukast , being a hygr0sc0pic m01ecu1e , is sensitiVe t0 Vari0us c0nditi0ns such as therma1 stress , 0XidatiVe stress , base hydr01ysis and acid hydr01ysis , ph0t0 degrada - ti0n , and Water hydr01ysis 1eading t0 f0rmati0n 0f impurities. [ 0008 ] Am0ng the Vari0us impurities 0f m0nte1ukast , m0k - 3 su1ph0xide and styrene impurity ( b0th deﬁned subsequent1y herein ) are the maj 0r kn0Wn impurities. Other kn0Wn impurities inc1ude quid - 8 , m0k - 3 ket0 , m0k - 1 - nitri1e , saturated ana10 g , m0nte1ukast desch10r0 impurities and an S - is0 - mer ( a11 deﬁned subsequent1y ) . May 14 , 2009. [ 0009 ] Regu1at0ry auth0rities W0r1dWide require that the 1eVe1s 0f the impurities sh0uld be maintained be10W the 10W - est p0ssib1e 1eVe1s in the c0mp0siti0n. Hence there is a need f0r stabi1ized c0mp0siti0ns c0mprising m0nte1ukast 0r its sa1ts.

[ 0023 ] The present inVenti0n re1ates t0 pharmaceutica1 c0mp0siti0ns 0f m0nte1ukast 0r their pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e sa1ts , so1Vates , p01ym0rphs , enanti0mers 0r miXtures. [ 0024 ] The number 0f pe0p1e suffering fr0m a11ergy - re - 1ated dis0rders such as f0r eXamp1e hay feVer , a11ergic rhinitis , p0is0n iVy 00ntact , and asthma has increased in recent years. US 2009 / 0124657 A1. [ 0025 ] The greatest preValence 0f asthma is in presch00I chi1dren. Asthma requires immediate perceiVab1e effect. Inha1ed therapy is m0st c0mm0n therapy prescribed f0r y0ung chi1dren. HOWeVer , inha1ed therapy has the disadVantage that d0se de1iVery may be VariabIe. SoIid 0raI d0sage f0rm has the adVantage 0f 0Verc0ming d0se Variabi1ity in c0mparis0n t0 inha1er therapy. [ 0026 ] There are feW cases Where 0ra1 administrati0n may n0t be p0 ssib1e such as When a patient has underg0ne surgery at neck p0rti0n ( pharynX , es0phagea1 , thyr0id etc ) , and cann0t sWa110W the s01id d0sage f0rm. In such cases cheWab1e d0s - age f0rms are used. [ 0027 ] The pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e salts 0f m0n - telukast refer t0 salts prepared f0rm pharmaceutica1ly accept - ab1e n0n - t0Xic bases inc1uding in0rganic bases and 0rganic bases , 0r acids inc1uding in0rganic and 0rganic acids. Sa1ts deriVed fr0m in0rganic bases inc1ude a1uminum , amm0nium , ca1cium , 00pper , ferric , ferr0us , lithium , magnesium , manganic salts , mangan0us , p0tassium , sOdium , Zinc , and the like. Sa1ts deriVed fr0m 0rganic n0n - t0Xic bases inc1ude , sa1ts 0f primary , sec0ndary , and tertiary amines , substituted amines inc1uding natura11y 0ccurring substituted amines. [ 0028 ] Surprisingly it has been 0bserVed that the leVels 0f tW0 maj0r impurities , namely m0k - 3 sulph0xide and a styrene impurity ) increase due t0 presence 0f m0isture c0ntent in the d0sage f0rm. Hence by reducing the m0isture c0ntent 0f d0sage f0rms by maintaining equilibrium re1atiVe humidity bel0W a deﬁned Value , the 1eVeIs 0f these impurities haVe been maintained be10W accepted 1eVe1s. [ 0029 ] During the manufacturing pr0cess , m0nte1ukast s0dium is pr0ne t0 a number 0f reacti0ns Which giVe rise t0 impurities.

F0rmula IX. CH2CO0Na. . [ 0038 ] It has been 0bserVed that m0nte1ukast s0dium is highly susceptible t0 0xidatiVe degradati0n ( including atm0 - spheric 0xygen ) , and acid hydr01ysis With signiﬁcant increase in the m0k - 3 squ0xide and styrene impurities , respectiVer , thus m0k - 3 sulf0xide and styrene impurity are tW0 0f the maj0r impurities. [ 0039 ] M0nte1ukast haVing a reduced 1eVe1 0f impurities may als0 c0ntain residual s0lVents such as hexane , cycl0hexane , heptane , acet0ne , methan01 , dich10r0methane , acet0nitri1e , t01uene , N , N - dimethy1f0rmamide , is0buty1 a1c0h01. Thus , in an emb0diment 0f the present inVenti0n , any residual s0IVents in puriﬁed m0nte1ukast are als0 c0nsidered as impurities. [ 0040 ] In an emb0diment 0f the present inVenti0n , the residua1 s0lVent c0ntent in the pharmaceuticaI c0mp0siti0ns is 1ess than the 1imits set in ICH guide1ines. [ 0041 ] In an emb0diment the present inVenti0n inc1udes stab1e pharmaceutica1 c0mp0siti0ns.

[ 0043 ] RelatiVe humidity is deﬁned as the rati0 0f the partia1 pressure 0f Water Vap0r in a gase0us mixture 0f air and Water t0 the saturated Vap0r pressure 0f Water at a giVen temperature. RelatiVe humidity is expressed as a percentage and is ca1cu1ated in the f0110Wing manner : . P ( H20 ) . RH = x 100%. . P [ H20 ) . May 14 , 2009. [ 0044 ] Equilibrium reIatiVe humidity 0r the ERH 0f a materia1 is the re1atiVe humidity When the m0Vement 0f m0isture fr0m a materia1 t0 the enVir0nment ( and Vice Versa ) haVe equa1ized. This ERH ba1ance is achieVed When Vap0ur pressures ( Within the materia1 and in the enVir0nment ) haVe equa1 - ized. At this p0int the m0isture 1eVe1 0f a materia1 can be expressed in terms 0f ERH. [ 0045 ] In an emb0diment the present inVenti0n inc1udes pr0cesses t0 achieVe a desired Va1ue 0f ERH , Wherein a pr0 - cess 00mprises : .

S0me 0f the c0ntainers 0f this kind inc1ude but are n0t limited t0 trip1e 1aminated p0uches 1ike trip1e 1aminated a1uminium f0i1 p0uches , and high density p0lyethy1ene 00ntainers. [ 0049 ] Suitab1e desiccants inc1ude , but are n0t 1imited t0 , silica gel , calcium sulfate , calcium chl0ride , m0ntm0rill0nite clay , and m0lecular sieVes. [ 0050 ] In an emb0diment the present inVenti0n inc1udes pharmaceutica1 c0mp0siti0ns c0ntaining m0ntelukast , Wherein the ERH f0r said pharmaceutica1 00mp0siti0ns is 1ess than ab0ut 25% , 20% , 15% , 0r 10%. [ 0051 ] Equilibrium relatiVe humidity may be measured using instruments such as Beckman Hygr01ine M0isture Meter , NOVa Sina / R0tr0nic M0isture - Humidity Meters , Hygr0dynamic Hygr0meter , and Weather - Measure Re1atiVe Humidity System.

The unif0rmity 0f c0ntent 0f actiVe is determined in terms 0f re1atiVe standard deViati0n. [ 0061 ] The unif0rm distributi0n 0f the drug in the f0rmulati0n may be achieVed by many Ways such as by using drug With unif0rm partic1e size distributi0n 0r by 0ptimizing different steps 0f pr0cessing 0f the 00mp0siti0n such as mixing and b1ending the actiVe and inactiVe excipients 0r by se1ecti0n 0f excipients and s0 0n.
