The lower section 1. of the. casing is provided with an opening through which eXtends a U - shaped pipe 18 which forms the main air intake duct , its inner end being in communication with the opening 5 ‘formed within the section 3. This U~shaped pipe 18 is provided with a depressed portion 19 having a restricted opemng formed in the upper cnd thereof which communicates with. ' the water reservoir. A needle valve 20 is. adjustably mounted within this section 1. Iand is adapted to operate within the open - . ing formed within the depressed portion 19. ”."whereby the proper amount of water may. be permitted to enter through the opening within the mining chamber. . The water reservoir formed within the. ‘lower section 1 of the casing is provided. with an intake port 21 in which is mounted a valve 22. This valve 22 is controlled by a ll - shaped ﬂoat 23 , mounted within the reservoir by means of a levcr 24 , the latter being pivotallymounted , as at 25 , within the intake port - - _. The interior of the section 3 of the casing forms a mising chamber for mining the. water and air as they are directed thereto , - . and to provide means for mising the air and water , l mount within the section 3 an arm 26 which has rot - atably ' mounted there on , a fan 27. This fan is provided with. . ball bearings to permit the isame to rotate. freely , and the said bearings are in commnnication by means of a passageway 28 with an oil cup 29 , which is mounted on said section 3 and eXtends eXteri0rly there - of. The section 6 , which is provided with a fuel reservoir , has formed therein an in~I take port 30 which is inIfcommunication. with a suitable source of. supply. This iu— , . take port 30 is provided w1th a va1ve 31 which is connected to an aluminum float 32 mounted within the reservoir 8 by means of a Y—shaped lever 33. - This lever being pivota1ly m0unted , as at. 34 : , within the in - . . take port , thercby provides means for regu - . 1ating the ﬂow of gasolene within the reservoir 8 at the same time keeping the fuel at the desired height therewithin. The interior of this section 6 is provided with an L - shaped entension ' 35 which eXtends within the bore 7 and has a valve seat formed in the upper end thereof for receiving a needle valve 36 which is adapted to control the ﬂow of gasolene or fuel to be mixed with. the air and water as it passes through the. bore 7. This valve 36 is detachably mount - ed within the upper end of the turning vh1ve 15 and ' has secured to the upper end thereof. w a pointer 37 , which is adapted to cooperate. 65 entering the intake port Iof theengine. The ' . with the graduations formed upon the top. of the ' valve , so that the operator can readily. see the enact amount of fuel which is being mined with the water and air prior to its. . i , oeo , eee. lower p0rtion of this valve is threaded , and has ' adjustably mounted thereon a bearing 38 the latter having loosely connected thereto a fan 39 , which obviously‘ thoroughly miXes the fuel and moistened air before the same enters the intake port of the engine. The eXtension 13 formed - upon the upper section 11 of the casing , is provided with a plurality of openings in which are adapted to operate weight valves 4.0. These openings formed within the eXtension 13 , are in. . communication with an auxiliary supply. pipe M which is in communication with the mining chamber formed within the section 3 of the casing. A priming lever t2 is mounted upon the section 11 and is pr0vided with a link which is adapted to engage the ‘ { —shaped lever 33. The turning valve 15 is provided with a depending flange in which is formed an opening dS which communicates with the enhaust port 12 and asimilar port 44 ; , which is in - communication with the auXi1iary air intake. The upper p0rtion of the turning va1ve 15 is provided with an enlarged cam head t5 and also has a lever dd by which the turning valve may be operated in the usual manner. - . The miiiing chamber , formed within the section 3 of the casing is provided with an auXiliary air intake port t7 which has mounted therein a spring actuating valve t8. An angular shaped 1ever d9 is pivotally mounted , as at 50 , upon the section 6 of the casing and its lower end is adapted to rest. against the stem Iof said spring actuated. valve 48 , whereas its ' opposite end is provided with a roller 51 which is adapted to. 70. 75. so. 85. 95. 100. operate upon the cam head formed upon the I. flange of thc turning valve 15. . lt is obvious from the foregoing description , taken in connection with ‘the accom - . 105. panying drawings , that when the engine is . started , it will draw ‘the air and a proper amount of water into the carbureter , which are thoroughly miaed by means of the fan. 110. 27 , and they are then drawn ‘from the fuel . intake port in. a constricted current wheré the mo1stened air and fuel are then thoroughly mixed by the fan 39 and then di~ rected to the intake ports of ' the engine. Upon increasing the. speed of the engine , the turning ' valve is rotated until the cam t5 comes in contact with . the lever tQ - which. - 11I5_ ' ". opens the spring actuated valve t8 , thereby I — - . allowing a greater volume of air - to enter. ‘an. the mimng chamber , and upon theincreased . ' . speed of the engine , the I suction created thereby , wi1l open - the walves tGF , . thcreby permitting a larger volume of the water and air to enter the mtake p0rt of the engine. ' 125 , . The section 11 has. formed , adjacent the . head thereof , a pair of inwardly eXtending studs or the like 52 which are adapted to operate within a pair of slots 53 formed in opposite . sides of the turning valve 15 and. 13.0 ‘. 10. 15. 2O. 25. 30. 35 ' . 1 , ose , 399. this connecti0n ‘betweenthe section 11 and the turning val - ve affords a Inean ' s for holding the latter in the carbureter. It will be noted that when the valVe 15. is rotated , the set serews will ride . within. the slcts 53 thereby causing the va1ve to rise When the 0pening 43 00mes in - alinement with the eXhaust port 12 as the slots 53 are inclined d0wnwardly as sh0wn clearly in Fig. 9 of the drawing. As the Valve rises , it als0 carries the - . stem 36 with it there - by opening the fuel inlet valve to‘ permit a greater v0lume of fuel to enter the carbureter when the speed of the engine isina creased. The af0resaid water intake pipe 21 is in e0mmunicati0n with the supp1y tank 54 by. means 0f a tubing 55. , This supply tank is. pr0Vided with brackets whereby the same‘ will be m0unted upon any suitab1e support 01 ' the framework. of an aut0mobile and is pr0vided with a ﬁlling opening. This tank‘ may also be proVided with a gage 58 by which . the correct amount of water contained within the tank wi1l be indicated. What I claim is : — ' . l.
