The present invention relates to compositions for topical application to the skin surface , in particular to skin wash compositions which are applied to water - wetted skin and subsequently rinsed off with water. Speciﬁcally , the present invention relates to skin wash compositions comprising an ot - hydroxy acid and other acids as deﬁned. herein as an active ingredient formulated in a mild and non—irritant detergent base. Compounds generally known in the ﬁe1d of cosmetic and therapeutic skin treatments as ot - hydroxy acids and other acids as deﬁned herein include compounds such as salicylic acid , lactic acid and glycolic acid. These compounds constitute the active ingredients of a number of commercially available products which are applied to the skin in order to confer a beneﬁcial effect with respect to appearance and skin condition , in particular smoothness and suppleness. Salicylic acid for example has been shown to have keratolytic and comedolytic activity as well as anti - bacterial efﬁcacy and has been used in the treatment and prevention of mild to moderate acne for more than lO0 years. Lactic acid has a beneﬁcial effect on skin hydration and is a. constituent of a number of skin tonic and moisturising products. ot—Hydroxy acids and other acids as deﬁned herein , whilst conferring a beneﬁcial effect on the skin , may cause local irritation when applied to sensitive areas of the skin. in particular the face. Moreover. local irritation may be exacerbated by the carrier system in which the active ingredient is formulated. For example , skin wash compositions and in particular face wash compositions which are generally formulated with a soap - free detergent base selected for effective cleansing and foaming , may confer an irritant effect due to the use of ionic surfactants commonly. employed in such detergent systems. A further problem associated with formulating compositions containing ot - hydroxy acids and other acids as deﬁned herein arises because of the desirability to formulate the composition at an acid pH at which the most efﬁcacious free - acid form of the acid. wil1 predominate. For skin wash compositions , this problem is exacerbated by the. _1. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. CA 02257810 2006—03—29. difﬁculty of obtaining a detergent base system at Sufficiently low pH. A skin wash composition described as having a gentle yet effective cleanser for acne treatment and containing 2.0° / o w / w salicylic acid in a detergent base comprising a mixture of anionic and amphoteric surfactants is commercially availabIe. Analysis of this. product , shows that it has a pH of 5. It follows , having regard to the pKa of salicylic. . acid which is attributed the value 2.97 , that the free - acid form of the hydroxy acid. does not predominate in this product and that its efﬁcacy is accordingly not ﬁ111y. optimised. An embodiment of the present invention may provide a skin wash composition containing. an ot - hydroxy acid or other acid as deﬁned herein and a detergent base which has good cleansing and foaming characteristics , is mild and non - irritant and wherein the pH of the composition approaches the pKa of the acid such that the efﬁcacy of the acid is enhanced. This object is achieved according to the present invention which is based on the unexpected ﬁnding that a detergent base comprising a mixture of a non - ionic alkylpolyglucoside surfactant and an amphoteric surfactant not only has the desired cleansing and foaming characteristics and is mild and non - irritant when applied to the. skin but also enables compositions to be formulated at low pH. According to the present invention there is provided a skin wash composition comprising from O.1 to W %w / w of an ot - hydroxy acid or other acid as deﬁned herein and a detergent base consisting of a mixture of a non - ionic alkylpolyglucoside surfactant and an amphoteric surfactant wherein the pH of the composition is in the. range 3.0 to 4.5. According to an aspect of the present invention , there is provided a skin wash composition comprising from 0.1 to 10 % w / w of an ( x - hydroxy acid , sa1icy1ic , maleic or pyruvic acid and a detergent base consisting of a mixture of from 2.0 to lS% W / w of a non—ionic a1ky1polyglucoside surfactant and from 2.0 to 8.0% w / w of an amphoteric. surfactant wherein the pH of said composition is in the range 3.0 to 4.5. 10. lS. 20. 25. CA 02257810 2006—03—29. According to another aspect of the present invention , there is provided an aqueous skin wash composition comprising from 0. l to lO% w / w of an a - hydroxy , salicylic , maleic or pyruvic acid and an amount of a detergent base not exceeding 30% w / w and which detergent base consists of a mixture of an amount of a non - ionic alkylpolyglucoside surfactant not exceeding 20% w / w and an amount of an amphoteric surfactant not. exceeding 10% w / w wherein the pH of the composition is in the range 3.0 to 4.5. According to another aspect of the present invention , there is provided a use of the composition as deﬁned herein for the manufacture of a medicament for use in the. treatment and / or prophy1axis of acne. According to another aspect of the present invention , there is provided a use of a. composition as deﬁned herein for use in the treatment and / or prophy1axis of acne. According to another aspect of the present invention , there is provided a non - therapeutic method of improving the appearance and / or condition of human skin comprising the. administration of a composition as deﬁned herein. According to another aspect of the present invention , there is provided a commercial package comprising the composition as deﬁned herein together with instructions for its. use for the treatment and / or prophy1axis of acne. Suitable acids for incorporation into skin wash compositions of the invention include salicylic acid , lactic acid , citric acid , glycolic acid , malic acid , maleic acid , pyruvic acid and hydroxy - octanoic acid. Preferred acids are salicy1ic acid , lactic acid and glycolic acid , especially salicylic acid and lactic acid.

A preferred concentration for. —2a—. 10. 15. 20. 25. 3O. CA 022578l0 l998 - lZ - 08. W0 97 / 47171 PCTlEP97l02984. salicylic acid is 2.0 %W / w. Lactic acid will suitabiy be present in compositions of the invention at a concentration in the range 0.1 to 5.0 %w / w , more suitably in the range 0.5 to 2.5 %w / w. A preferred concentration for lactic acid is 1 %w / w. Glycolic acid. wil1 suitably be present at a concentration in the range 2.0 to 10.0 %w / w. As used herein , the term alkylpolyglucoside surfactant means a non - ionic surfactant derived from common natural organic monomer units as found in starch , fats and sugars , and most suitably derived from D - glucose monomer units. Alkylpolyglucosides derived from D - glucose are acetal compounds in which the aIkyl residue has a carbon chain length of from 8 to 16 carbon atoms and the degree of glucosidation ( or polymerisation ) , ie. the average number of g1ucose units per alkyl radical , is between H and 6. A range of suitable alkylpo1yglucosides are commercially available either individually or as mixtures or blends. Compositions according to this invention will generally contain mixtures or blends of different alkylpolyglucosides. Preferred alkylpolyglucosides for use in the present invention include decyl glucoside and lauryl glucoside and mixtures thereof. Alkylpolyg1ucoside surfactants generally comprise up to 20 %w / w of the skin wash composition , suitably from 2.0 to 15.0 %w / w and preferably from 4.0 to l0.0 %w / w of the composition. It will be appreciated that the amount of alkylpolyglucoside will be determined to some extent by the nature and amount of amphoteric surfactant. present in the composition. In principle , any amphoteric surfactant which is acceptab1e for topical application to the skin may contribute , with the alkylpolyglucoside surfactant , to the detergent base but , in view of their inherent mildness and good foaming performance , the preferred amphoteric surfactant will belong to the class of compounds known as betaines. Structurally , betaine compounds contain a carboxylate functional group and a quaternary nitrogen function separated by a methylene moiety. They include n - alkyl betaines such as cetyl betaine and behenyl betaine , and n - alkylamido betaines such as cocoamidopropyl betaine. The amphoteric surfactant component of the detergent base. for compositions of the present invention may be a single compound or a mixture of. - 3 - .

A preferred amphoteric surfactant is cocoamidopropy1 betaine. Amphoteric surfactants will generally comprise up to lO %w / w of the skin wash composition , suitab1y from 2.0 to 8.0 %w / w and preferably from 2.5 to 6.0% w / w of the skin wash composition. The amount of amphoteric surfactant will to some extent be determined by the alkylpolyglucoside surfactant. component of the detergent base. Typically , the detergent base consisting of the mixture of non - ionic alkylpolyglucoside surfactant and amphoteric surfactant wi11 constitute up to 30 %w / w of the skin wash composition. Suitably the detergent base wil1 constitute from 5.0 to 20.0 %w / w and more suitably from 8.0 to ] 8.0 %w / w of the skin wash. composition. Control of pH to within deﬁned limits is an essentia1 feature of the present invention. A pH within the desired range 3.0 to 4.5 is conferred partly by the inherent properties of the acid and speciﬁc surfactants and quantities thereof making up the detergent base and partly , where required , by use of a suitable neutralising agent for the acid. Any topical1y acceptable neutralising agent which is compatible with the other components of the composition can be used. It has been found that the neutra1ising agent tromethamine is particularly suitable for skin wash compositions containing Othydroxy acids or other acids as deﬁned herein. Other suitable neutralising agents include sodium hydroxide and triethano1arnine. The amount of neutralising agent will be determined by the acid / base properties of the other ingredients which make up the. composition and the pH selected for the composition. The skin wash compositions of the invention may a1so contain additional topically acceptable skin conditioning and soothing agents , for example in the form of anti— inﬂammatory agents and vitamins or vitamin derivatives , typically at low concentrations , for example in the range 0.01 to 2.0 %w / w of the total composition. Examples of topical1y acceptable anti - inﬂammatory agents inc1ude allantoin and. - 4_. RECTIFIED SHEET ( RULE 9l ) ISA / EP. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. CA 022578l0 l998 - lZ - 08.
