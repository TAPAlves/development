PACAP SIGNALING PATHWAY MODULATORS FOR TREATING INFLAMMATORY SKIN DISEASES HAVING A NEUROGENIC COMPONENT , NOTABLY ROSACEA , AND COMPOSITIONS COMPRISED THEREOF. [ 0001 ] The inVenti0n re1ates t0 the use 0f m0dulat0rs 0f speciﬁc PACAP recept0rs f0r treating inflammatory skin diseases with a neur0genic 00mp0nent , and m0re particu1ar1y r0sacea and / 0r facia1 erythema , 00mp0siti0n 00ntaining them and screening meth0ds f0r identifying PACAP signaI1ing pathway m0du1at0rs. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. [ 0002 ] The present inVenti0n re1ates t0 the use 0f m0du1a - t0rs 0f speciﬁc PACAP ( Pituitary adeny1ate cyc1ase actiVating p01ypeptide , 0r ‘PACAP ) recept0rs f0r treating inﬂamma - t0ry skin diseases with a neur0genic c0mp0nent , and m0re particu1ar1y acne , r0sacea , facia1 erythema , urticaria and at0pic dermatitis.

[ 0004 ] An0ther emb0diment 0f this inVenti0n re1ates t0 the identiﬁcati0n and the use 0f c0mp0unds which are m0du1a - t0rs 0f the PACAP signal1ing pathway pr0teins , f0r the treatment 0f inﬂammat0ry skin diseases with a neur0genic 00m - p0nent , and m0re particu1ar1y acne , r0 sacea , facia1 erythema , urticaria and at0pic dermatitis. It aIs0 re1ates t0 meth0ds f0r the in Vitr0 diagn0sis 0r in Vitr0 pr0gn0sis 0f these path0I0 - gies. [ 0005 ] R0sacea is a c0mm0n , chr0nic and pr0gressiVe inﬂammat0ry dermatitis ass0ciated with Vascu1ar instabi1ity. It main1y affects the centraI part 0f the face and is characterized by redness 0f the face 0r h0t ﬂushes , faciaI erythema , papu1es , pustu1es and te1angiectasia. In seri0us cases , especia11y in men , the soft tissue 0f the n0se may swe11 and pr0duce a bulb0us swel1ing kn0wn as rhin0phyma. [ 0006 ] R0sacea genera11y 0ccurs between the ages 0f 25 and 70 , and is much m0re c0mm0n in pe0p1e 0f fair c0mp1eX - i0n. It m0re particu1ar1y affects w0men , a1th0ugh this affec - ti0n is genera1Iy m0re seVere in men. R0sacea is chr0nic and 1asts f0r years with peri0ds 0f eXacerbati0n and 0f remissi0n. [ 0007 ] R0sacea was 0rigina11y ca11ed ‘acne r0sacea because its papu1es ( p0ints 0f slight raising 0f the skin ) and its inﬂammat0ry pustu1es ( pus scabs ) great1y resemb1e th0se 0f c0mm0n acne. In c0ntrast with c0mm0n acne , wh0se aeti01 - 0gy is based 0n abn0rma1 keratinizati0n , an increase in sebum pr0ducti0n and a1s0 bacteria1 inflammati0n , the inﬂammati0n 0f r0 sacea is Vascu1ar in nature and is p00r1y underst00d. The resu1t 0f this facia1 Vascu1ar an0ma1y is a permanent 0edema 0f the dermis , which may be acc0mpanied by an increased 0010mzati0n with Dem0deX f011icu10rum , a mite usual1y f0und in the f011ic1es 0f the face. [ 0008 ] The path0genesis 0f r0sacea is p00r1y underst00d. Many fact0rs may be inV01Ved with0ut necessari1y inducing this c0mp1aint. They are , f0r eXamp1e , psych010gica1 fact0rs , gastr0intestina1 dis0rders , enVir0nmenta1fact0rs ( eXp0sure t0 sun1ight , temperature , humidity ) , em0ti0na1 fact0rs ( stress ) , .

[ 0009 ] R0sacea is characterized by seVeral primary and sec0ndary features , which 0ften 0ccur t0gether. The disease can be gr0uped in f0ur subtypes , h0weVer , patients may haVe characteristics 0f m0re than 0ne r0sacea subtype at the same time , and the disease d0es n0t necessari1y eV01Ve fr0m 0ne subtype t0 the neXt ( Wilkin et a1. Standard c1assiﬁcati0n 0f r0 sacea : Rep0rt 0f the Nati0na1 R0 sacea Society EXpert C0m - mittee 0n the C1assiﬁcati0n and Staging 0f R0sacea , 2002 , J. Am. Acad. Dermat01. V01 46 , pages 584 - 587 ) : . Subtype 1 : Erythemat0te1angiectatic R0sacea. [ 0010 ] Erythemat0te1angiectatic r0sacea is main1y characterized by ﬂushing and persistent centra1 facia1 erythema. The appearance 0f te1angiectases is c0mm0n but n0t essentia1 f0r a diagn0sis 0f this subtype. CentraI faciaI edema , stinging and burning sensati0ns , and r0ughness 0r scaling may a1s0 be rep0rted. A hist0ry 0f ﬂushing a10ne is c0mm0n am0ng patients presenting with erythemat0te1angiectatic r0sacea. Subtype 2 : Papu10pustu1ar R0sacea. [ 0011 ] Papu10pustular r0sacea is characterized by persistent centra1 faciaI erythema with transient papuIes 0r pustu1es 0r b0th in a centra1 facia1 distributi0n. H0weVer , papu1es and pustu1es a1s0 may 0ccur peri0riﬁcia11y ( that is , they may cccur in the peri0ra1 , perinasa1 , 0r peri0cu1ar areas ) . The papu10pustuIar subtype resemb1es acne Vngaris , except that c0med0nes are absent. R0sacea and acne may 0ccur c0n - c0mitant1y , and such patients may haVe c0med0nes as we11 as the papu1es and pustu1es 0f r0sacea. Burning and stinging sensati0ns may be rep0rted by patients with papu10pustu1ar r0sacea. [ 0012 ] This subtype has 0ften been seen after 0r in c0mbinati0n with subtype 1 , inc1uding the presence 0f te1angiectases. The te1angiectases may be 0bscured by persistent erythema , papu1es , 0r pustu1es , and tend t0 bec0me m0re VisibIe after successful treatment 0f these masking c0mp0 - nents. Subtype 3 : Phymat0us R0sacea. [ 0013 ] Phymat0us r0sacea inc1udes thickening skin , irregu1ar surface n0du1arities , and en1argement. Rhin0phyma is the m0st 00mm0n presentati0n , but phymat0us r0sacea may 0ccur in 0ther 10cati0ns , incIuding the chin , f0rehead , cheeks , and ears. Patients with this subtype a1s0 may haVe patu10us , eXpressiVe f011ic1es in the phymat0us area , and te1angiectases may be present. [ 0014 ] This subtype has frequent1y been 0bserVed after 0r in c0mbinati0n with subtypes 1 0r 2 , inc1uding persistent erythema , te1angiectases , papules , and pustu1es. In the case 0f rhin0phyma , these additi0na1 stigmata may be especia11y pr0 - n0unced in the nasa1 area. Subtype 4 : Ocu1ar R0sacea. [ 0015 ] The diagn0sis 0f 0cuIar r0sacea sh0u1d be c0nsidered when a patients eyes haVe 0ne 0r m0re 0f the f01l0wing signs and sympt0ms : watery 0r b100dsh0t appearance ( inter - pa1pebra1 c0njunctiVa1 hyperemia ) , f0reign b0dy sensati0n , burning 0r stinging , dryness , itching , 1i ght sensitiVity , blurred Visi0n , te1angiectases 0f the c0njunctiVa and 1id margin , 0r 1id and peri0cu1ar erythema. B1epharitis , c0njunctiVitis , and irregu1arity 0f the eyelid margins als0 may 0ccur. Meib0mian. US 2011 / 0229423 A1. gland dysfuncti0n presenting as chalazi0n 0r chr0nic staphy - 10c0cca1 infecti0n as manifested by h0rde0lum ( stye ) are c0mm0n signs 0f r0sacea - re1ated 0cu1ar disease. Some patients may haVe decreased Visua1 acuity caused by 00mea1 c0mp1icati0ns ( punctate keratitis , 00rnea1 inﬁ1trates / u1cers , 0r marginal keratitis ) . Treatment 0f cutane0us r0sacea al0ne may be inadequate in terms 0f lessening the risk 0f Visi0n loss resulting fr0m 0cu1ar r0sacea , and an 0phthalm010gic appr0ach may be needed. [ 0016 ] Ocular r0sacea is m0st frequent1y diagn0sed when cutane0us signs and sympt0ms 0f r0sacea are als0 present. H0weVer , skin signs and sympt0ms are n0t prerequisite t0 the diagn0sis , and limited studies suggest that 0cular signs and sympt0ms may cccur bef0re cutane0us manifestati0ns in up t0 20% 0f patients with 0cu1ar r0sacea. Appr0ximate1y ha1f 0f these patients experience skin lesi0ns ﬁrst , and a min0rity haVe b0th manifestati0ns simu1tane0usly. [ 0017 ] C0ncerning f0r examp1e subtype 1 , n0 efﬁcient treatments are aVai1ab1e. Papu10pustu1ar r0 sacea can be treated with t0pical metr0nidaz01e 0r aze1aic acid , as we11 as systemic antibi0tics 0f the cycline class. Phymat0us r0sacea 0f the n0se is treated by surgery. In summary , 0n acc0unt 0f the mu1ti - fact0r aspect 0f r0sacea , there are a huge number 0f treatments with re1atiVe1y weak efﬁcacy f0r thjs c0nditi0n , but the search c0ntinues f0r an effectiVe treatment that is with0ut risk f0r the patient.
