PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF CONJUGATES OF GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANES ( GAG ) WITH BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE MOLECULES , POLYMERIC CONJUGATES AND RELATIVE USES THEREOF. [ 0001 ] The present inVention relates to a process for the synthesis of conjugates of glycosaminoglycanes ( GAG ) With biologically actiVe molecules of a Varying nature , comprising small molecules and macro - molecules. In particular , the present inVention relates to the conjugation of hyaluronic acid ( HA ) and its deriVatiVes with polypeptides and proteins with a biological action , such as interferons , erythropoietins , growth factors , insulin , cytokines , antibodies and hormones. [ 0002 ] The use of polymers in the biomedical ﬁeld is completely general and widespread. Hydrogels with a polymeric base , for example , are commonly used for reducing surgical adherences in abdominal surgery , in reconstruction and cosmetic surgery , in controlled release systems consisting of gelinatous matriXes or as biomaterials. [ 0003 ] Another important eXample is the deriVatiZation of molecules with a pharmacological action with polymeric chains , which improVes the solubility and concea1s the molecules With respect to degradation processes , prolonging their action. [ 0004 ] The most typical example in this conteXt , is polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) Which , although not present in liVing organisms , is ﬁ111y biocompatible and not immunogenic. PEG is commonly used for implementing the performances of biological drugs ( therapeutic proteins ) . Pegylated alfainterferone , or peg - interferon is Worth mentioning , for eXample , Which has superseded the simple recombinant Version of the protein , becoming the chosen therapy for Viral hepatitis as Well as a true blockbuster ( European patent EP0809996 ) . The limit of the ﬁ1nctionalization of proteins with PEG is bound to the attainment of conjugates with irregular ﬁmctionalization , or , in any case , polydispersed patterns. Furthermore , the Various isomers obtained can be characterized by a different biological actiVity , bio - aVailability , half - life , immunogenic poWer. [ 0005 ] For this reason , in the nineties , pegylation methods were introduced so as to obtain proteins modiﬁed only in speciﬁc sites ; among these , the N - terminal end is the most accessible as a result of its pKa considerably different with respect to all other amine groups present in the proteins. [ 0006 ] In this respect , Pepinsky et al. ( Pepinsky R B , Le Page D J , Gill A , et al. J Pharmac EXp Ther , 2001 297 ( 3 ) : 1059 - 1066 ) , haVe speciﬁcally studied the introduction of a PEG chain at the N - terminal end of the beta 1 interferon ( Which is used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis ) through reductiVe alkylation obtained from an aldehyde deriVatiVe of PEG. The adduct obtained shoWed a better efﬁcacy in ViVo due the increased half - life. [ 0007 ] Another protein which has been modiﬁed With PEG thanks to this approach , is G - CSF , a grthh factor and actiVation of neutrophylic granulocytes which Kinstler et al , functionalized at the N - terminal end ( US Pat. No. 6 , 153 , 655 patent ) . The corresponding product ( Pegﬁlgrastim ) has already been on the market since 2002. [ 0008 ] In the group of polymers in the biomedical ﬁeld , bio - polymers are of particular interest. Some of these are naturally present in the human tissues and haVe properties of. May 10 , 2012. biocompatibility and non - immunogenicity , which represent an important added Value in this conteXt. Among these biopolymers , glycosaminoglycans ( GAG ) are of particular interest , i. e. non - branched polysaccharides haVing a high molecular weight , consisting of disaccharide repetition units. GAGS , for eXample , haVe a structural ﬁmction in the connectiVe tissue , tendons and cartilage or they can act as anticoagulants. [ 0009 ] Hyaluronic acid ( HA ) is a GAG Which can be found in the extra - cellular matrix with a structural role inVolVed in the cell motility process but also has Visco - elastic ﬁ1nction in addition to being a hydrating and proliferation agent , Thanks to these particular characteristics , HA and its deriVatiVes are used as matriX for bio - materials ( EP 216453 ) and controlled release systems ﬂiS. Pat. No. 4 , 582 , 865 & US Pat. No. 4 , 636 , 524 ; K. M0tokaWa et. al. , J0uma [ 0fBi0medicaZ Materials Research PartA , ( 2006 ) , pag. 459 ) . [ 0010 ] HA is also inVolVed in molecular recognition and regulation mechanisms , as it is recogniZed by cell receptors such as RHAMM ( CD168 ) , CD44 , LYVE1 , Layilin. The interaction speciﬁcity of HA with CD44 is of particular importance. This receptor , in fact , is oVerexpressed in the majority of solid cancers of an epithelial origin ; by binding drugs haVing an anti - cancer actiVity to HA , the actiVe targeting of the biopolymer can be eXploited , which alloWs the endocytosis and release of the anti - cancer agent inside the neoplastic cell ( international patent application WO2009001209 ) . [ 0011 ] The deriVatiZation of therapeutic agents With hydrosoluble polymers ( as , for eXample , GAG ) is particularly use - ﬁ11 in the case of polypeptides , polypeptide hormones and proteins. This class of molecules , in fact , has a structure which is eXtremely susceptible to eVen small modiﬁcations , caused by the enVironment in which they are present. Furthermore , polypeptides and proteins normally haVe an efﬁcacy time span Very limited by their short half - life. This is why their ﬁ1nctionalization with hydrosoluble polymers is extremely important , also improVing the solubility , bio - aVailability and reducing the immunogenicity. [ 0012 ] Conjugation methods of GAG with proteins through diVinyl sulfone ( US Pat. No. 7 , 034 , 127 Which particularly refers to IFN ) , disulphide bridges ( US Pat. No. 7 , 417 , 021 ) , are known in the art. The only method Which alloWs the control of the deriVatization site is the reaction through the formation of disulphide bridges ; in this case the polymer can on1y bind itself in correspondence With residues of cysteine in a reduced form. [ 0013 ] If the polypeptide chain only has one single cysteine residue aVailable , and in reduced form , the deriVatization method is in fact speciﬁc , but this is quite a rare case. Proteins , in fact , often haVe numerous cysteine residues , but , aboVe all , it often happens that these residues are already engaged in disulﬁde bridges Whose reduction inVolVes signiﬁcant rearrangements Which can lead to the loss of the ﬁ1nctionality of the protein. [ 0014 ] None of the methods of the knoWn art alloWs a uniVocal functionalization pattern to be obtained , eVen maintaining the biological actiVity of the protein , therefore an effectiVely mono - dispersed and efﬁcient product. [ 0015 ] On the basis of the aboVe , the necessity of aVailing of a conjugation process of bioactiVe molecules , such as proteins and polypeptides , to GAG ( i. e. HA ) Without compromising the protein functionality , is eVident. US 2012 / 0114602 A1. [ 0016 ] The authors of the present inVention haVe noW set up a conjugation process of glycosaminoglycanes haVing biologically actiVe molecules ( i. e. proteins and polypeptides ) capable of oVercoming the limits of the prior art , as it allows GAGs ( such as HA ) to be bound With no modiﬁcation of the basic structure of the protein and jeopardizing its functionality. A further characteristic Which distinguishes the conjugates betWeen GAG and a therapeutic agent ( TA ) of the present inVention With respect to the conjugates knoWn in the state of the art , consists in the fact that the present conjugation method leads to the formation of an almost mono - dispersed adduct and not to an isomeric mixture of products With different chemical , physical , biological characteristics , Whose behaViour , therapeutic efﬁcacy and toxicological proﬁle are Variable. [ 0017 ] Furthermore , by suitably Varying some of the process parameters ( i. e. pH ) , it is also possible to select the amine groups of the biologically actiVe molecule to Which the glycosaminoglycane is bound ; it is possible , for example , to speciﬁcally bind the hydrosoluble polymer HA to the N - terminal end. [ 0018 ] In the case of drugs such as proteins and polypeptides , the coupling to the amine group often takes place through acylation , Which leads to the formation of amides , whose nitrogen is no longer capable of participating in acidbase equilibria. [ 0019 ] The conjugation method of the present inVention is characterized in that it does not imply any alteration of the net charge present in the actiVe species , which leads to the transformation of a primary amine to a secondary amine that maintains the capacity of exchanging protons. This is a clear adVantage in terms of maintenance of the biological actiVity of TA. [ 0020 ] EVen more surprisingly , the authors of the inVention haVe discoVered that the bio conjugates of the present inVention are capable of increasing the efﬁcacy of the conjugated drug and to maintaining it With time ( see Example 10 HA conjugate - insulin ) . [ 0021 ] The conjugation of the therapeutic agent With the hydrosoluble polymer , improVes it characteristics , making it more soluble , bio - aVailable and more actiVe , Unlike the hydrosoluble polymers described in the state of the art ( such as , for example , polyethylene glycol , PEG ) , the use of glycosaminoglycanes alloWs excellent drug deliVery systems to be obtained , Which are capab1e of directing the therapeutic agent with a speciﬁcity inaccessible With other types of polymers. This speciﬁcity is determined by the complex system of receptor interactions Which inVolVe GAGs , Furthermore , the use of biopolymers Which , although interacting With the cell receptors , do not promote an immunological response , results in a synergetic action with a higher efﬁcacy. [ 0022 ] The present inVention describes a process for the synthesis of conjugates of glycosaminoglycanes ( GAG ) With biologically actiVe molecules , comprising the following phases : . a ) deriVatization of the GAG With at least one aldehyde group ( CHO ) , by reaction of the GAG With a spacer molecule ( SP ) , wherein said spacer molecule comprises , as ﬁrst functional group , one or more aldehyde groups ( SP - CHO ) , said aldehyde groups ( SP - ( CHO ) ) being optionally protected and , as second ﬁ1nctional group , a nucleophilic group suitable for conjugation With the GAG ; . a1 ) hydrolysis of the actiVated intermediate with aqueous acids when said one or more aldehyde group ( s ) is protected ; . May 10 , 2012. b ) reaction of the adduct obtained in phase a ) or a1 ) With at least one biologically actiVe molecu1e ( TA ) characterized in that it comprises a functional group capable of reacting with the aldehyde group. [ 0023 ] Hydrogels consisting of hyaluronic acid functionalized With amine or aldehyde groups ( protected or non - protected ) are known in the state of the art , these deriVatiVes , hoWeVer , are subsequently cross - linked with other molecules of the same polysaccharide possibly deriVatized With different functional groups which are such as to react with the amine or aldehyde group of the starting ﬁ1nctionalized hyaluronic acid ( EP1757314 ; Bulpitt P , et al. J 0f Bi0medicaI Marerials Research , 1999 47 ( 2 ) : 152 - 169 ) . [ 0024 ] As already mentioned , glycosaminoglycanes ( GAGs ) , are non - branched polysaccharides haVing a high molecular weight , consisting of disaccharide repetition units. A common characteristic of GAGs is the presence of a carboxylic ﬁ1nctional group per disaccharide unit , Which can appear in nature in acid or saliﬁed form , thus generating polyanions. In the present inVention , the acronym GAG indifferently indicates the acid form or the saliﬁed form of polysaccharides , and in this case the most typical counterions are alkaline and alkaline - earth metals , such as sodium , potassium , magnesium , calcium. Polymers classiﬁed as GAG , comprise : hyaluronic acid , condroitin sulphate , dermatan sulphate , keratan sulphate , heparin , heparan sulphate. The GAGs to be used within the present inVention can be in natiVe form or in the form of semi synthetic deriVatiVes including quaternary ammonium salts , carboxylic esters , O - esters , amides , percarboxylated deriVatiVes , O - sulfated deriVatiVes , N - deacetylated deriVatiVes , N - sulfated deriVatiVes , or mixed deriVatiVes characterized by the simultaneous presence of these modiﬁcations. The acronym GAG is used hereinafter to indicate both the mentioned polymers in natiVe form or the corresponding semisynthetic deriVatiVes. [ 0025 ] EVen if GAGs , in normal representations as structure formulae , do not carry any aldehyde group , it is worth remembering that the natural equilibrium Which is established in the solution betWeen the open form and the closed form of the reducing end , passes through the formation of a functional aldehyde group. This presence is quantitatiVely extremely limited , hoWeVer , as the length of the polymeric chains creates a low quantity of reducing ends. When the molecular Weight of the GAG diminishes , on the other hand , the releVant quantity of reducing ends aVailable in aldehyde form progressiVely increases , until it becomes quantitatiVely useful for the oligomers of GAGs ; this is the only case in which the reducing ends can be efﬁcaciously used for effecting the conjugation process described in this document. [ 0026 ] In all other cases , considering that the aldehyde group is rather unstable eVen under mild conditions , it is conVenient to introduce it synthetically into the hydro soluble polymer in the form of protected aldehyde. In this Way , it is possible to isolate an actiVated intermediate Which is subsequently reacted With the TA , Without haVing to put all the components in contact in a single reaction mixture. [ 0027 ] The conjugates according to the present inVention are linked in that the therapeutic agent TA is bound to the hydrosoluble polymer as secondary or tertiary amine. The presence of the aldehyde group ( possibly protected as described in phase a ) ) , as a means for enabling the bond betWeen the therapeutic agent and GAG , and the synthesis method prepared by the Applicant and illustrated in the. US 2012 / 0114602 A1. present document should be considered as being the characteristic feature of the present inVention. [ 0028 ] The adduct thus obtained in phase a ) is stable enough to alloW it to be isolated , but once the aldehyde groups haVe been released , it is aVailable with respect to the deriVatization reaction With the therapeutic agent of interest. [ 0029 ] The conjugate obtained can be described by the folloWing general formula : . GAG— SP - TA. wherein GAG indicates the Glycosaminoglycane , SP a spacer arm and TA the therapeutic agent. [ 0030 ] Translating the symbology of this deriVatization method , the folloWing is obtained : . GAG + SP - ( CHO ) —>GAG - SP - ( CHO ) Phase a. GAG - SP - ( CHO ) —>GAG - SP - CHO Phase a1. GAG - SP - CHO + TA—>GAG - SP - TA Phase b. Wherein CHO indicates the ﬁmctional aldehyde group , protected if between brackets. [ 0031 ] This protection can be easily obtained With the organic synthesis techniques knoWn to experts in the ﬁeld. A conVenient form of protection , for example , consists in the use of hemiacetals or acetals , obtained through the reaction of aldehydes with aliphatic or aryl aliphatic alcohols or diols , comprising for example , methanol , ethanol , n - propanol , isopropanol , n - butanol , sec - butanol , tert - butanol , iso - butanol , ethylene glycol , propylene glycol , 1 , 3 - propandiol , 1 , 4 - butandiol and structurally similar molecules , and capable of reacting With the aldehydes to form isolatable acetals. The product of phase ( a ) represents What is deﬁned as “actiVated intermediate” or “actiVated but isolatable semisynthetic intermediate”. [ 0032 ] The chemistry used for the functionalization of GAG with the spacer arm to obtain the actiVated intermediate can be selected each time using the ﬁmctional groups present in the polymer or in the corresponding semisynthetic deriVatiVe , i. e. the carboxylic group , hydroxyl groups ( 4 for each repetitiVe unit ) , sometimes present in the form of alkyl or O - sulfated esters , the N - acetyl group , the N - sulfated group. Furthermore , the coupling conditions between the GAG and spacer arm must be such as to not alter the aldehyde group , or remoVe its protection when present. [ 003 3 ] The spacer arm must contain a functional group suitable for the coValent union with the GAG , preferably a nucleophilic such as , for example , an amine or alcohol group. The amine group , in free form or saliﬁed With suitable salts is preferred for its greater nucleophilicity. The spacer molecule SP - ( CHO ) is preferably an amino - aldehyde , eVen more preferably protected as acetal. [ 003 4 ] Examples of molecules Which can be used as spacer arm of the GAG - SP - ( CHO ) type comprise amino - aldehyde acetals thus composed : . [ 0035 ] Amine group , free or in the form of a salt. [ 003 6 ] A hydrocarbon chain , preferably aliphatic With a number of carbon atoms ranging from 1 to 20. [ 0037 ] An aldehyde group , preferably in the form of an acetal according to the following scheme , in which n ranges from 1 to 20 Whereas R and R ' can be aliphatic or aryl - aliphatic residues , the same or different , or the same chain Which carries Various hydroxyl groups. May 10 , 2012. [ 0038 ] The aliphatic chain , in addition to being linear as schematized , can be branched , or contain aryl groups. [ 0039 ] The Applicant has Veriﬁed that a conVenient coupling method consists in the formation of amides , in Which the GAG participates as carboxylic acid , and the spacer arm as amine. This type of reaction is effected according to organic synthesis techniques knoWn to experts in the ﬁeld , and can be carried out for example With the help of condensing agents which promote the nucleophilic attack towards the carboxylic acids. These reagents include those Which can be used in the peptide synthesis in homogeneous or heterogeneous phase. Examples of these agents are carbonyl diimidazole , di - succinimidyl carbonate , carbodiimmides such as , for example , 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropy1 ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) ; N , N ' - dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ; N - al1yl - N ' - ( B - hydroxyethyl ) carbodiimide ; N - ( a - dimethylaminopropyl - N ' - tert - butylcarbodimide ; N - ( o. - dimethylaminopropyl ) - N ' - ( [ 3 - bromoallyl ) carbodimide ; 1 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - 3 - ( 6 - benzoylaminohexyl ) carbodimide ; Cyclohexyl methylmorpholine ) ethyl carbodiimide p - toluenesulfonate ( CMC ) and similar products. [ 0040 ] The reaction can be carried out in an aqueous medium or in an organic solVent at a temperature ranging from —10 to 700 C. depending on the type of actiVation used. When the preparation is carried out in a non - aqueous medium , it is conVenient to use GAG salts Which are more soluble under these conditions , for example tetra - alkylammonium salts. These counter - ions must in any case be eliminated by means of the ion exchange process , to be effected on the deriVatized polymer before its isolation. [ 0041 ] The tetra - alkylammonium salts of GAG ( in particular of HA ) are normally soluble in aprotic polar solVents , such as N - methyl - pyrrolidone ( N MP ) , dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) , dimethylformamide ( DMF ) , Which are suitable as reaction medium. The use of these solVents is conVeniently coupled With the use of carbonyl diimidazole as condensing agent , whose action is faVoured by a slightly acid enVironment for small quantities of strong acids , for example gaseous hydroch10ric acid bubbled in solution or methane - sulfonic acid. Other organic solVents suitable for effecting this type of synthesis of the actiVated intermediate are organic carbonates , comprising propylene carbonate , diethyl carbonate , and in general organic carbonates substituted by aliphatic , aromatic or aryl - aliphatic chains. [ 0042 ] The reaction is interrupted by the addition of a saturated solution of an alkaline halide , for example NaCl , NaBr , KCl , KBr. The hydration of the reaction mixture deactiVates the promoters of the formation of amide bonds , Whereas the salt , added in such a quantity as to be in strong excess with respect to the moles of repetitiVe unit of GAG , causes an effectiVe ion exchange. The stoichiometric requirement of the strong excess is obtained by adding a quantity of saturated solution of alkaline halide ranging from 0.5% to 30% by Volume , and preferably from 5 to 15% by Volume. [ 0043 ] The corresponding alkaline salt of the actiVated intermediate is subsequently puriﬁed by dialysis , then freezedried. Although this product is isolatable and stable , it is. US 2012 / 0114602 A1. actiVe With respect to the subsequent functionalization reaction With therapeutic agents containing functional groups susceptible to reaction towards the aldehydes. [ 0044 ] An altematiVe puriﬁcation / isolation method of the actiVated intermediate consists in applying precipitationwashing cycles With mixtures of solVents haVing an adequate polarity. The precipitation - Washing can be effected , for example , With alcohols such as methanol , ethanol , n - propanol , isopropanol and higher homologues , possibly mixed with Water ; other suitable solVents are acetone , ethyl acetate , tetrahydroﬁ1ran , dioxane , acetonitrile , aprotic polar solVents ( for example dimethylformamide , dimethylsulfoxide , n - methyl pyrrolidone , n - methylacetamide ) , organic carbonates. Each of the mentioned solVents can be used alone or in a mixture with any other solVent or With Water in order to obtain the polarity and other physico - chemical characteristics with greater accuracy. Mixtures comprising the aboVe alcohols , acetone and Water are preferred. [ 0045 ] Phase ( b ) Which describes the coupling betWeen the GAG - SP - ( CHO ) and TA takes place through a ﬁrst phase a1 ) for releasing the aldehyde group ( When protected ) , Which consists in hydrolysis of the acetal Which is effected by treatment With aqueous acids according to the standard techniques knoWn to experts in the ﬁeld.

[ 0065 ] The substances listed aboVe are indicated hereafter as “therapeutic agents” ( abbreViated TA ) or “actiVe species”. [ 0066 ] The molecular structure of the TA must carry a ﬁ1nctional group capable of reacting With aldehydes , for example an amine group. If this group is not present in the TA , it can be introduced by means of synthetic organic chemistry. US 2012 / 0114602 A1. techniques knoWn to experts in the ﬁeld. In this Way , it is possible to Virtually bind any molecule to GAG. [ 0067 ] Within the scope of the present inVention , the use of hyaluronic acid ( HA ) and its salts indicated aboVe , is of particular interest. The HA used in the present inVention can deriVe from any source ; it can be produced , for example , by extraction of cockscombs , fermentatiVely , or biotechnologically , and haVe a molecular weight ranging from 400 to 3 ><106 Da , preferably from 1x103 Da to 1><106 Da , eVen more preferably from 10 , 000 to 750 , 000 Da. [ 0068 ] The deriVatization reaction of the inVention can be applied to both the polysaccharide as such and to the same preViously modiﬁed. Molecular netWorks are thus obtained starting from hyaluronic acid Variably modiﬁed according to knoWn methods and in particular : . [ 0069 ] HA saliﬁed With organic and / or inorganic bases ( EP 138572 B1 ) ; . [ 0070 ] HYAFF® : esters of HA with alcohols of the aliphatic , aryl - aliphatic , cycloaliphatic , aromatic , cyclic and heterocyclic series , With an esteriﬁcation percentage Which can Vary according to the type and length of the alcohol used , preferably from 20 to 80% , Whereas the remaining percentage of non - esteriﬁed HA can be saliﬁed with organic and / or inorganic bases ( EP 216453 ) ; . [ 0071 ] HYADD® : amides of HA With amines of the aliphatic , ar - aliphatic , cycloaliphatic , aromatic , cyclic and heterocyclic series , with an amidation percentage of 0.1 to 50% , whereas the remaining percentage of HA not subjected to amidation can be saliﬁed With organic and / or inorganic bases ( EP 1095064 ) ; . [ 0072 ] O - sulfated deriVatiVes of HA up to the 4M degree of sulfation ( EP 702699 ) ; . [ 0073 ] ACP® : internal esters of HA With an esteriﬁcation percentage not higher than 20% , preferably from 0.05 to lO% of esteriﬁcation , whereas the remaining percentage of nonesteriﬁed HA can be saliﬁed with organic and / or inorganic bases ( EP 341745 ) ; . [ 0074 ] deacetylates of HA : these deriVe from the deacetylation of the N - acetyl - glucosamine residues present in HA , with a deacetylation percentage preferably ranging from 0.1 to 30% , whereas all the carboxylic groups of HA can be saliﬁed With organic and / or inorganic bases ( EP 13l3772 ) ; [ 0075 ] HYOXXTM : percarboxylate deriVatiVes of HA obtained from the oxidation of the primary hydroxyl of the N - acetyl - glucosamine fraction with a percarboxylation degree of 0.1 to 100% and preferably from 25 to 75%. All the carboxylic groups of HA can be saliﬁed with organic and / or inorganic bases ( EP 1339753 ) . [ 0076 ] According to a preferred embodiment of the inVention , the conjugation process betWeen HA and therapeutic agents comprises the folloWing phases : . a ) deriVatization reaction of HA with protected amino - aldehydes SP - ( CHO ) in Which HA participates in the reaction with the carboxylic group Which forms an amide With the amine of the amino - aldehyde. This passage is preferably carried outfrom starting HATBA ( tetrabutylamonium salt of HA ) or another salt soluble in an organic aprotic polar solVent ( DMSO , NMP , DMF , organic carbonates ) . The actiVated but isolatable intermediate ( which is a ﬁ1rther object of the inVention , QUESTA ERASE é DA TOGLIERE ) is obtained from this passage. a1 ) hydrolysis of the actiVated intermediate i. e. HA - SP - ( CHO ) —>HA - SP - CHO to release the aldehyde group : reaction With phosphoric acid within a pH range of 1.5 - 3 , prefer - . May 10 , 2012. ably With a pH ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 , at a temperature ranging from 25 to 65° C. , preferably from 40° C. to 60° C. , for at least 30 minutes ; . b ) conjugation reaction of the actiVated intermediate with the TA molecule , preferably a protein. By adding the protein under reducing conditions With sodium cyanoborohydride , there is the formation of imine and therefore an amine. If the therapeutic agent selected is a polyﬁ1nctional compound , there is the possibility of creating different positional isomers with different chemical , physical and biological characteristics. Ihis condition is typically Veriﬁed in the case of proteins , of Which interferon , Which has 12 potential binding sites , represents an example. By changing the pH at which this reaction is effected , a speciﬁc ﬁ1nctionalization is preferably generated at the N - terminal ( pH=6.0 ) with all the adVantages that this implies or a ﬁ1nctionalization with HA bound to the protein in Various points , With a non - reproducible scheme ( pH§7.5 ) . [ 0077 ] The chemistry used for preparing the conjugates according to the present inVention allows the functionalization pattern to be effectiVely selected. [ 0078 ] This important result is reached thanks to the use of the aldehyde group , whose particular reactiVity With respect to nucleophilic attacks enables a sufﬁcient selectiVity with respect to the nucleophilic poWer of the ingoing group. The speciﬁc conditions for conVeniently exerting this selectiVity are determined from case to case through progressiVe optimizations. Returning to the example of the mo st important poly - ﬁ1nctional actiVe species , i. e. the proteins , the nucleophilic amine groups can be found in positions haVing different accessibilities , but aboVe all can be distinguished With respect to their strength as bases , expressed as pKa. The amine groups in a position present in the lysine residues typically show a pKa ranging from 9.3 to 9.5 , Whereas the amine groups in a at the carboxyl haVe a pKa typically ranging from 7.6 to 8. In order to faVour the reaction of the amines in e the coupling process must be carried out at a pH higher than 8 .0 , preferably ranging from 8.5 to 9 .0 ; in order to faVour the reactiVity of the amines at the N - terminal , on the other hand , the pH must be within the range of 5.0 and 6.5 , and preferably betWeen 5.5 and 6.2. This second case is the mo st important as the proteins typically haVe only one free a - amine group , situated at the N - terminal end. Establishing the reaction conditions so as to preValently react this amine group leads to the formation of an almost monodispersed conjugate betWeen GAG and proteins. [ 0079 ] Although the pH Values indicated mostly represent the proteins of interest for the present inVention , they are indicatiVe as they may shift slightly for different molecules. [ 0080 ] This synthesis procedure allows bioactiVe conjugates to be obtained , haVing substantially higher performances With respect to the conjugates knoWn in the state of the art. By studying the biological properties of these neW conjugates , the Applicant has in fact found substantially higher characteristics With respect to the polymeric conjugates knoWn in the state of the art. [ 0081 ] In particular , the conjugates of the inVention obtained after deriVatization With hyaluronic acid maintain the biological properties of both the actiVe principle and starting polysaccharide , but they are characterized by different mechanical and rheological properties. The conditions under which the coupling process is effected are such as to not modify the biological functionality of the TA. US 2012 / 0114602 A1. [ 0082 ] The applicant has in fact applied the synthesis process according to the present inVention for synthesizing neW bioconjugates : [ 0083 ] betWeen hyaluronic acid ( HA ) and interferon ( IFNo. ) [ 0084 ] between hyaluronic acid and the growth hormone ( hCH ) [ 0085 ] between hyaluronic acid ( HA ) and RNAse A [ 0086 ] betWeen hyaluronic acid and insulin , [ 0087 ] betWeen hyaluronic acid and salmon calcitonin ( HA - sCT ) [ 0088 ] betWeen hyaluronic acid and IL1 - ra [ 0089 ] betWeen hyaluronic acid and Lubricin , which are therefore an object of the present inVention. [ 0090 ] The preparation of the HA - IFNo. conjugate is described in Example 3. Recombinant human IFN alpha 2a is a protein haVing a molecular weight of about 20 kDa Whose structure is characterized by 4 cysteines Which form 2 disul - ﬁde bridges and 12 amine groups , of Which 11 in the side chain of lysine residues , plus the N - terminal end. It sh0uld be noted that of the two disulﬁde bridges present in the natiVe protein , that included betWeen the residues 29 and 138 is fundamental for the biological actiVity , consequently the reducing conditions necessary for applying the method according to US Pat. No. 7 , 417 , 021 Would be destructiVe. [ 0091 ] The synthesis conditions used are such as to obtain an almost monodispersed conjugate , with the HA preValently bound to the N - terminal end of the cytokine. This speciﬁcity is reﬁected on a maintenance and / or increase of the biological actiVity of the IFN and / or other bioconjugates , for Whose measurement the method according to Example 4 has been deVeloped. [ 0092 ] Fluorescence tomography experiments Were effected on the same HA - IFN conjugate , to obserVe the biodistribution in ViVo folloWing endoVenous administration. In order t0 alloW it to be reVealed With this technique , the bioconjugate Was prepared according to Example 6 , so as to include a coValently bound ﬁuorescent probe. The biodistribution proﬁle found ( Example 7 ) shoWs that in a rather rapid time scale , the ﬁuorescence preValently accumulates at a hepatic leVel , and to a lesser extent in the chest area , due to non - speciﬁc entrapment in the pulmonary microcirculation. In more lengthy times , an accumulation in the pelVic , in particular Vesical region is also obserVed , justiﬁed not so much by the normal absorption - excretion mechanism of the bioconjugate , but by the slow hydrolysis and release of the ﬁuorescent probe. The eVidence of this substantial hepatic and pulmonary accumulation reVeals a ﬁ1rther interesting property , which is not presented by the conjugates knoWn in the state of the art , i. e. the possibility of directing the therapeutic species speciﬁcally to certain types of tissue. [ 0093 ] A further object of the inVention therefore relates to the use in the medical ﬁeld of the conjugates according to the inVention , in particular in antiViral and antitumoral therapy. According to a preferred embodiment , an object of the inVention relates to the use of the HA - IFN conjugate as a system for stimulating the immune system with respect to Viral - type infections , such as hepatitis ( preferably by endoVenous administration ) or pathologies caused by Viral agents , such as , for example , herpes labia1is , genitalis , and in infections caused by HPV ( Human Papilloma Virus ) capab1e of causing Verrucas ( preferably by topic application ) or cerVix cancer. The HA - IFN conjugate can therefore also be adVantageously used as antitumoral agent. May 10 , 2012. [ 0094 ] As shoWn in Example 10 , the HA - insulin conjugate not only doubly increases the pharmacological efﬁcacy of the therapeutic agent , but it also maintains the capacity of the insulin of controlling the basal glucose leVel with time. In this case , a further property of the bioconj ugate is reVealed , Which consists in creating controlled release systems of therapeutic agents. [ 0095 ] In Example 9 Which illustrates the preparation of the bioconjugate HA - RNAse A , the maintenance of the biological actiVity of the bound enzyme is eVen more eVident , as the measurement of the enzymatic actiVity is effected , directly folloWing the concentration of the substrate with spectroscopic techniques. [ 0096 ] The applicant also Veriﬁed that , once conjugated to HA and administered endoVenously , the therapeutic agent shoWs a rapid and quantitatiVe hepatic and pulmonary accumulation. This aspect of the inVention makes its use particularly adVantageous in therapies relating to pathologies Which interest the liVer , such as for example , Virus - correlated hepatopathies , hepatic ﬁbrosis , cirrhosis of the liVer , Gauch - ers disease , liVer and lung tumors. The kinetics and effectiVeness of the hepatic and pulmonary entrapment of the conjugate depend on the HA , by modifying its molecular weight , the accumulation proﬁle can be modiﬁed until it becomes negligible. [ 0097 ] EndoVenous administration , on the other hand , is not the only possible way. The Applicant has in fact Veriﬁed that subcutaneous administration of the conjugate is effectiVe in slole releasing the TA ( Example 10 ) . [ 0098 ] Example I 1 illustrates the preparation process of the bioconjugate HA - calcitonin : calcitonin is a 32 - amino acid linear polypeptide hormone that is produced in humans primarily by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid , this hormone participates in calcium ( Ca2 + ) and phosphorus metabolism. To be speciﬁc , calcitonin affects blood Ca2 + leVels in four ways : [ 0099 ] Inhibits Ca2 + absorption by the intestines [ 0100 ] Inhibits osteoclast actiVity in bones [ 0101 ] Inhibits phosphate reabsorption by the kidney tubules [ 0102 ] Increases absolute Ca2 + and Mg2 + reabsorption by the kidney tubules , calcitonin is a renal Ca - conserVing hormone. [ 0103 ] Therefore , calcitonin is used for the treatment of : [ 0104 ] Postmenopausalosteoporosis [ 0105 ] Hypocalcaemia [ 0106 ] Pagets disease [ 0107 ] Bone metastases [ 0108 ] Calcitonin has short absorption and elimination half - liVes of 10 - 15 minutes and 50 - 80 minutes , respectiVely. Salmon calcitonin is primarily and almost exclusiVely degraded in the kidneys , forming pharmacologically - inactiVe fragments of the molecule. [ 0109 ] The neW bioconjugate HA - calcitonin is therefore extremely important , due to the fact that , as described in Example 11 , it reVeals a more prolonged hypocalcemizing action With respect to the free hormone , alloWing a more marked effect Which enables us to study new clinical uses such as intra - articular administration for the protection of the cartilages and bones in degeneratiVe pathologies such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and arthrosis. [ 0110 ] Example 13 illustrates the synthesis process of the bioconjugate HA - Lubricin : lubricin is present in synoVial ﬁuid and on the surface of articular cartilage and therefore. US 2012 / 0114602 A1. plays an important role in joint lubrication and synoVial homeostasis. Human synoVial ﬁbroblasts haVe been shown to produce lubricin. [ 0111 ] Optimal functionality of synoVial joints is dependent upon extremely loW coefﬁcients of friction betWeen articulating tissues. Normally , a contiguous , Well - lubricated surface is maintained on articular cartilage. During osteoarthritis ( OA ) , hoWeVer , reduced lubrication contributes to cartilage matrix degradation and ﬁbrillation ; these in turn contribute to joint dysﬁmction and pain. Reduced lubrication also leads to joint dysfunction and pain in other forms of arthritis , including rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The expression of lubricin has also been detected and the protein localised in tendon , meniscus , lung , liVer , heart , bone , ligament , muscle and skin. [ 0112 ] For these tissues a lubricated surface also contributes t0 optimal functionality. In addition to requiring a lubricated surface , normal tendon ﬁmction requires the preVention of cellular adhesion to tendon surfaces. [ 0113 ] Therefore , the Applicant is describing the new use for the neW bioconjugate HA - lubricin , as lubricants , antiadhesiVe agents and / or intra - articular supplements for , e. g. , synoVial joints , meniscus , tendon , peritoneum , pericardium and pleura , alloWing a residence time in situ and a higher effectiVeness than that described for non - conjugated TAs. [ 0114 ] In this context , the conjugates according to the present inVention can be adVantageously used as systems for the controlled release of TAs. These systems are extremely useﬁ11 for TAs Which haVe a therapeutic effectiVeness WindoW limited by a restricted lifetime. Typical examples of TAs haVing these characteristics are therapeutic proteins , comprising cytokines , grthh factors , enzymes , hormones , such as f0r example GH , Glucocerebrosidase , SOD , ILI - ra , insulin and analogues , GM - CSF , GCSF , FPO and in general the ESAs described aboVe , interferons of type I , II , III , monoclonal antibodies , fusion proteins and others. Insulin , for example Was the ﬁrst biotechnological drug and continues to haVe primary importance as it is fundamental for the growing number of people suffering from diabetes. Retard forms of insulin are currently aVailable , but drug - deliVery systems are not present on the market ( conjugation to polymers , micronanoparticles ) . [ 0115 ] As shoWn in Example 10 , the conjugation method according to the present inVention is suitable for creating controlled release systems which are effectiVe in slole releasing the TA in actiVe form , and prolonging the action , doubling its therapeutic effectiVeness. Also to be taken into account is the further aspect relating to the compliance of the patients Who in the present therapeutic regime must undergo Various daily subcutaneous administrations with eVident inconVeniences in their social life and in the progressiVe exhaustion of sites suitable for the injection. Analogous considerations are also Valid f0r the other therapeutic substances listed in the present document. [ 01 1 6 ] The conjugates betWeen hyaluronic acid ( preferably its deriVatiVes ) and therapeutic agents according to the present inVention can therefore be adVantageously used for the preparation of biomaterials With higher characteristics of effectiVeness , biocompatibility , bioaVailability , the possibility of directing the TA to speciﬁc types of cell or organ tissues , and the possibility of improVing the pharmacokinetic proﬁle by the controlled release and increased lifetime of the TA. [ 0117 ] The conjugates betWeen hyaluronic acid and therapeutic agents according to the present inVention can be adVantageously used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compo - . May 10 , 2012. sitions suitable for parenteral or non - parenteral administration , comprising formulations for oral use , injectable solutions by intradermal , endoVenous , intramuscular , subcutaneous , ( intradermal da toglire , scritto 2 Volte! ) , intraarterial , intrathecal , intracardiac , intrasynoVial , intraperitoneal , intraVesical injection , or gels , creams , ointments , foams , dry poWder , sprays , cutaneous or transdermal plasters for topic use , but also pharmaceutical preparations for rectal , intraVaginal , sublingual , intraocular use. [ 0118 ] According to a preferred embodiment of the present inVention , the pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for endoVenous administration for a hepatic and / or pulmonary localization. According to a further preferred embodiment , the pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for subcutaneous administration by means of controlled release systems. [ 0119 ] The conjugates according to the inVention maintain the biological ﬁ1nction of the actiVe principles contained therein , but With respect to the isolated form of these , they can be used as systems for their Vehiculation and controlled release. The Vehiculation towards speciﬁc tissues or types of cells is obtained by suitably selecting the type of GAG or semisynthetic deriVatiVe , whereas the release kinetics is modulated through the nature of the bond between the GAG or semisynthetic deriVatiVe and actiVe species. [ 0120 ] Finally , the inVention relates to a biomaterial characterized by a matrix comprising the conjugates as deﬁned aboVe. [ 0121 ] The present inVention is noW described for illustratiVe but non - limiting purposes , according to its preferred embodiments with particular reference to the ﬁgures of the enclosed drawings , in Which : .

[ 0135 ] The inVention is now described in greater detail in the folloWing examples , for the purpose , without limiting its possible applications , of proViding a better understanding and illustrating possible embodiments thereof , Which can in any case be Varied by experts in the ﬁeld Without jeopardizing its basic spirit. EXAMPLES. [ 0136 ] The scheme in FIG. 1 illustrates the succession of reactions of the synthesis process of GAG - TA conjugates described aboVe , describing the molecular structure of the species inVolVed. Hyaluronic acid ( HA ) is represented for illustratiVe purposes as GAG , whereas the spacer arm prototype Which carries the protected aldehyde group represented is 4 - amino - butyraldehyde - diacetal. Example 1. Synthesis of an Aldehyde DeriVatiVe of HA HaVing an AVerage Molecular Weight of 200 kDa. [ 0137 ] 5.00 g of hyaluronic acid of a sodium salt fermentatiVe origin hyalastine fraction ( MW 200 kDa ) are dissolVed in 250 ml of Water and the resulting solution is percolated through a glass column pre - ﬁlled With 100 cm3 of DoWex resin in the form of tetrabutylammonium.

Example 4. Determination In V1tro of the Biological ActiVity of the HA - IFN Conjugate. [ 0143 ] The determination of the biological actiVity of the HA - IFN conjugate was effected by means of a method prepared ad hoc. [ 0144 ] The experiments Were carried out on a human primary cell line of oVarian carcinoma ( deVCA1 ) , sensitiVe to the antiproliferatiVe action of IFN. The cells Were seeded at a concentration of 10 , 000 cells / Well and incubated alone and in the presence of : .

The biological actiVity of the conjugate is tested through the determination of the glucose leVels in the blood of animals , measured by means of commercial kits ( OneTouch® II , LifeScan , Johnson & Johnson ) , The control consists of healthy rats ( group 1 ) and rats With induced diabetes treated with insulin ( group 2 ) . The results are illustrated in FIG. 9. [ 0163 ] The rats treated With insulin belonging to group 2 shoW a sudden decrease in the glucose leVel in the blood , which howeVer returns to high Values in a relatiVely rapid time scale. The HA - Insulin conjugate has an effect Which is exerted more slole , but has a considerably prolonged duration With time , bringing the concentration of glucose , Within a time span of 5 hours , to a loWer leVel than the group treated with insulin alone , and maintaining this effect for the 24 hour duration of the experiment.
