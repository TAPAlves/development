[ 0001 ] This inVention re1ates , e. g. , to improVed agents based meta1 - containing comp1eX compounds suitab1e for NMR , X - ray , u1trasound and radiodiagnosis and therapy and a process for their production. [ 0002 ] substances Were eXperimenta11y tested as “contrast media” to boost the insuﬁicient contrast of body ﬂuids and soft tissues ( Barke , R. Roentgenkontrastmitte1 [ X - ray Contrast Media ] ; Chemie , Physio1ogie , K1inik VEB Georg Thieme Leipzig , 1970 ) . HeaVy e1ements Were suitab1e as the X - ray absorbing e1ements of such contrast media. ln the course of a 10ng se1ection and optimization process , ﬁna11y on1y contrast media based on iodine ( in a stab1e organic bond ) or barium ( as a near1y inso1ub1e su1fate ) remained. Barium su1fate is used eXc1usiVe1y for Visua1ization of the gastrointestina1 tract and it does not penetrate the body. [ 0003 ] With the deVe1opment of nuc1ear medicine , e. g. , the use of radioactiVe e1ements for Visua1izing certain structures of the organism and patho1ogica1 areas and especially for functiona1 diagnosis and for radiotherapy , a series of. Soon after the discoVery of X - rays the most Varied. other meta1s Was accepted for in ViVo diagnosis. The - so - ca11ed radiopharmaceutica1s used in nuc1ear medicine contain either a radioactiVe isotope of iodine ( 13l1 or 123 l ) or preferab1y a metal such as 99mtechnetium. These elements are bonded to an organic substance in many cases or , in the case of the radioactiVe meta1 isotope , are administered in comp1eXed form. Most often , the stabi1ity of the comp1eXing of the meta1s is such that , during its stay in the body , a more or less large portion of the metal cannot be preVented from being re1eased from its bond to the organic mo1ecu1e. Thus , in genera1 , the meta1 ion 10ses its desired pharmacokinetic and diagnostic properties produced by the comp1eXing , is e1iminated on1y Very s1oW1y , disturbs the distribution picture , speciﬁc in itself , of the isotope that is still bonded and can eXhibit its inherently toxic properties. [ 0004 ] At the beginning of the 1980s the interest in meta1 comp1exes in diagnostics and therapy increased further. With the deVe1opment of nuclear spin tomography there arose the question of producing contrast , e. g. , signa1 - influencing substances that cou1d be introduced into the body from the outside. Such sub stances he1p to recognize diseases earlier and more accurately. As an e1fectiVe principle , com - p1eX paramagnetic meta1 ions Were introduced Which , despite a re1atiVe1y high dosage ( e. g. , seVera1 grams of comp1ex that contain about 1 - 2 g of heaVy meta1 ) and rapid intraVenous injection , haVe proVen to be surprisingly We11 to1erated ( R. Fe1iX , W. Schoemer , M. Laniado , H. P. Niendorf , C. C1aussen , W. Fieg1er , U. Speck ; Radio1ogy 156 , 3 : 681 - 688 ( 1985 ) ) . Especia11y notab1e is the obVious1y outstanding acute to1erance of gado1inium - DTPA ( European patent application 71564 ) , the most adVanced preparation to date in c1inica1 use. The eXtreme1y 10W number and the mi1d nature of the acute side e1fects caused by gado1inium - DTPA make it appear suitab1e also for use in connection With certain X - ray techniques. The necessity of higher dosages and of repeated administration eXists for a series of diagnostic prob1ems in nuc1ear spin tomography and Very genera11y in X - ray diagnosis. ln this connection , the question of. hﬂ.27 , 2006. 10ng - term tolerance of substances containing heaVy meta1s must be giVen great attention. [ 0005 ] Unlike the case for iodine in the iodine - containing X - ray contrast media , the centra1 atoms in the meta1 - containing comp1ex compounds that are suitab1e for NMR , X - ray , u1trasound and radiodiagnosis and for therapy are not bonded coVa1ent1y. The bond of the meta1 ion is subject to equi1ibrium With the surroundings ijch , according to nature , shou1d be on the side of the comp1eX as much as possib1e. HoWeVer , a permanent bond can neVer be attained. ln addition it shou1d be noted that the stabi1ity constants , some Very high , indicated for the comp1eXes re1ate to unphysio1ogica11y high pH Values and do not apply for the in ViVo situation. Further , in ViVo , a concurrence of different ions is inVo1Ved in the bond to the comp1exing agents so that the probabi1ity for the undesired and sometimes dangerous re1ease of heaVy meta1 ions in the organism increases. [ 0006 ] [ 0007 ] [ 000s ] . [ 0009 ] . [ 0010 ] the more chemica11y or metabo1ica11y unstab1e the comp1exi11g agent is and. The danger becomes greater the higher the dosage of the heaVy meta1 comp1eX the more often the comp1eX is used. the 10nger it remains in the body. [ 0011 ] . [ 0012 ] On the other hand , tissue - speciﬁc comp1eXes , for eXamp1e a1so those comp1eXes bonded to biomo1ecu1es or macromo1ecu1es , desired for diagnosis and radiotherapy of certain types of patho1ogica1 changes are precise1y those , in. the more it penetrates the ce11s of the body. comparison to gado1inium - DTPA , characterized by a 10nger and more intrace11u1ar stay in the body. [ 0013 ] Thus , for diVerse purposes , there is a need for better tolerated agents in Which a re1ease of the heaVy meta1 ion in question from the comp1ex compound is preVented as much as possible. SUMMARY OF THE lNVENTlON. [ 0014 ] Thus , it is an object of the inVention to make aVai1ab1e such a pharmaceutica1 agent , as We11 as a process for its production. [ 0015 ] Upon further study of the speciﬁcation and appended c1aims , further objects and adVantages of this inVention Wi11 become apparent to those ski11ed in the art. [ 0016 ] 1t has been found that adding one or more free comp1exing agent ( s ) and / or one or more Weak meta1 com - p1ex ( es ) or their mixtures to pharmaceutical agents based on meta1 comp1eXes surprising1y yie1ds unobjectionab1y to1er - ab1e comp1eXes. [ 0017 ] 1n tbis connection , the comp1exing agent can be identica1 or different in a11 three components , i. e. , in the diagnostic agent or therapeutic agent , in the additiVe com - p1eXing agent , and in the additiVe of a Weaker meta1 com - p1eX. Suitab1e such comp1exing agents inc1ude , for eXamp1e , the comp1exing agents disc1osed in patent app1ications EP 71.564 ( e. g. , ethy1enediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA , dieth - y1enetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA and many others ) , DE - OS 3401052 ( e. g. , 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 - tetraazacyc1ododecane - N , N ' , N" , N ' " - tetraacetic acid DOTA , trans - 1 , 2 - cyc1oheXy1enediamine - N , N , N ' , N ' - tetraacetic acid and many.

No. 4 , 647 , 447 and US Ser. Nos. 936 , 055 of NoV. 28 , 1986 , 020 , 992 of Mar. 2 , 1987 , 627 , 143 of Ju1. 2 , 1984 , 063 , 355 of Jun. 18 , 1987 , 078 , 507 of Ju1. 28 , 1987 , 100 , 681 of Sep. 24 , 1987 , and others. [ 0018 ] Among suitab1e Weaker meta1 comp1eXes are those that haVe a re1atiVe1y 10W stabi1ity constant ; preferred are those that haVe , as a centra1 atom , a meta1 ion of e1ements occurring natura11y in the organism such as ca1cium , magnesium , zinc and iron. [ 0019 ] The additiVes to be used in accordance With this inVention can be routine1y se1ected by those of ski11 in the art in accordance With this speciﬁcation. The comp1exing agents used as additiVes , as noted e1seWhere , can be se1ected from the Wide Variety of comp1eXing agents knoWn to be useful che1ating agents for meta1s , and especia11y from those disc1osed as being usefu1 in conjunction With forming meta1 comp1eXes usefu1 for the mentioned diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The magnitude of the diﬁ°erence betWeen the stabi1ity constants of the actiVe comp1eX and the additiVe comp1eX is not critica1 ; it is important on1y that the stabi1ity constant of the additiVe comp1eX be 10Wer than that of the actiVe comp1ex. Typica11y , hoWeVer , the difference betWeen the stabi1ity constants of the WW comp1eXes Wi11 be on the order of at 1east 102. [ 0020 ] The meta1 of the meta1 comp1eX additiVe Wi11 in a11 cases be different from the meta1 of the actiVe meta1 comp1eX and , as mentioned be1oW , most preferab1y Wi11 be a physiologica11y We11 - to1erated meta1 such as one Which is natura1 in the organism but , in a11 cases , Wi11 haVe a bio1ogica1 to1erance Which is greater than that of the meta1 per se in the actiVe meta1 comp1eX. [ 0021 ] The comp1eXing agents ( che1ating agents ) and meta1 comp1eXes can be used in the form of physio1ogica11y aceptab1e sa1ts of inorganic ( e. g. , potassium , sodium , 1ithium hydroXide ) or organic ( e. g. , primary , secondary , tertiary amines such as ethano1amine , morpho1ine , g1ucamine , N - methy1 , N , N - dimethy1g1ucamine ) bases , basic amino acids and amino acid amides ( e. g. , 1ysine , arginine , ornithine ) or acids ( e. g. , g1ucuronic acid , acetic acid ) , etc. , e. g. , as disc1osed in the documents cited aboVe.

[ 0049 ] ln pharmaco1ogica1 tests it Was estab1ished that , . despite an abso1ute and re1atiVe1y 10W dosage , an added portion of free comp1eXing agents or of a Weaker meta1 comp1ex Very signiﬁcant1y promoted the comp1ete e1imination of the heaVy meta1 ion. [ 0052 ] This obserVed e1fect of the addition of comp1eXing agents or of a Weak meta1 comp1ex to pharmaceutica1 preparations based on meta1 - comp1eXes Was in no Way predictab1e ; in fact , it contradicts corresponding in - Vitro determinations. [ 0053 ] An assessment of the in - ViVo situation is made practica11y impossib1e by the fact that a11 forms of the comp1exing agent can interact With ions produced in the body and , on the other hand , offer numerous and in p1aces eXtreme1y stab1e bonding points ( proteins ; natura1 comp1eX - . US 2006 / O165591 A1. ing agents ; anions that form Very s1ight1y so1ub1e sa1ts ) for heaVy meta1s. 1n addition , to acbieVe the object of making aVai1ab1e better to1erated diagnostic media , one - prejudice of the man of the arthad to be oVercome : preVious1y , in the production of contrast media based on meta1 comp1exes , carefu1 attention Was a1Ways paid to the fact that there Was no excess of either meta1 ions or free comp1exing agents or a Weaker com - p1ex in the so1ution , since it is knoWn that the free comp1exing agents and the Weaker comp1exes of the comp1exing agents With meta1 ions such as Ca2 + are 1ess We11 to1erated than the stronger comp1exes With the heaVy meta1 ions suitab1e for diagnostics or therapy. [ 0054 ] A surprise of the present inVention thus a1so is in the extraordinari1y strong eﬁ°ect of the addition of free comp1exing agents or of Weak comp1exes to the meta1 comp1ex proVided for use , e. g. , on human beings With reference to the stabi1ity of the bond of the meta1 and thus its detoxiﬁcation and e1imination. This adVantage is , in VieW of the Very s1oW e1imination of heaVy - meta1s and their inherent toxicity , of such great signiﬁcance that for this reason a someWhat reduced acute to1erance of a preparation can possib1y be accepted. [ 0055 ] To achieVe the desired object , Very lOW concentrations and dosages are typica11y suﬁicient. There is an upper 1imit on the dosage of the comp1exing agent or of the Weaker comp1exes due to their acute to1erance.
