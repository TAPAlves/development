[ 0002 ] This inVenti0n re1ates t0 00mp0siti0ns and techniques f0r 10ca1ized therapy. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. [ 0003 ] At present , numer0us therapeutic techniques inV0lVe the systemic deliVery 0f 0ne 0r m0re therapeutic agents. Systemic de1iVery techniques , h0WeVer , are n0t We11 suited t0 a11 therapies. F0r instance , systemic de1iVery requires eXp0sing sites 0ther than the site 0f interest t0 a therapeutic agent. Indeed , large quantities 0f therapeutic agent Within the entire system are 0fter1 required t0 0btain the desired effect at a desired site. As a resu1t , the therapeutic agent c0ncentrati0n at the site 0f interest is 0ften1imited by the detrimenta1 effects 0f the agent at sites rem0te fr0m the site 0f interest. [ 0004 ] Systemic de1iVery techniques are a1s0 c0mm0n1y undesirable in that the therapeutic agent is degraded and eliminated by an 0rgan system ( s ) rem0te fr0m the site 0f interest. [ 0005 ] The ab0Ve pr0blems can be aV0ided by techniques in Which a therapeutic agent is 10ca11y de1iVered t0 a site 0f interest. In resp0nse t0 this rec0gniti0n , techniques and articles f0r the loca1ized deliVery 0f therapeutic agents t0 b0dily tissue haVe been deVel0ped. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION.

It is als0 desirable in seVeral emb0diments t0 release fact0rs that inhibit the pr0ducti0n 0f harmfu1 0xygen c0n - taining c0mp0unds , such as th0se discussed ab0Ve , by NO. [ 0062 ] By disp0sing the actiVat0r and precurs0r m01ecu1es up0n 0r Within a medica1 artic1e in an appr0priate c0nﬁgurati0n , the nitr0s0thi01 precurs0r m01ecules are released 00ncurrently With the NO d0n0r c0mp0unds. As a result , the NO pr0duced / released fr0m NO d0n0r c0mp0unds reacts With the nitr0s0thi01 precurs0r m01ecu1es in ViV0 at the treatment site , f0rming nitr0s0thi01m01ecu1es. Hence , these m0lecu1es haVe a therapeutic eﬁect 0n a targeted disease state Via a local de1iVery mechanism. [ 0063 ] In s0me preferred emb0diments , the nitr0s0thi01 precurs0r ( e. g. , thi01 ) and NO d0n0r are deliVered as a ﬁuid t0 a treatment site , f0r examp1e , by 10ca1 de1iVery thr0ugh a medica1 artic1e such as an infusi0n ba1100n catheter , a need1e injecti0n catheter 0r Via direct injecti0n.
