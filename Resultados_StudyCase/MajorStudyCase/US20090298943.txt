[ 0002 ] The present inVenti0n pr0Vides f0r neW use f0r creatine c0mp0unds ( creatine ana10gues and c0mp0unds Which m0du1ate 0ne 0r m0re 0f the structura1 0r functi0na1 c0mp0 - nents 0f the creatine kinase / creatine ph0sphate system ) as therapeutic agents. M0re particu1ar1y , the present inVenti0n pr0Vides a meth0d 0f treating 0r preVenting certain metab01ic dis0rders 0f human and anima1 metab01ism relating t0 aberrant b0dy Weight regu1ati0n as manifested in 0besity and its re1ated dis0rders. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. [ 0003 ] There are seVera1 metab01ic diseases 0f human and anima1 metab01ism , eg. , 0besity and seVere Weight 10ss that relate t0 energy imba1ance—Where ca10ric intake Versus energy eXpenditure7is imba1anced. Obesity , Which can be deﬁned as a b0dy Weight m0re than 20% in eXcess 0f the idea1 b0dy Weight , is a maj0r hea1th pr0b1em in Western afﬂuent societies. It is as s0ciated With an increased risk f0r cardi0Vas - cu1ar disease , hypertensi0n , diabetes , hyper1ipidaemia and an increased m0rta1ity rate. Obesity is the result 0f a p0sitiVe energy ba1ance , as a c0nsequence 0f an increased rati0 0f ca10ric intake t0 energy eXpenditure. The m01ecu1ar fact0rs regu1ating f00d intake and b0dy Weight balance are inc0m - p1ete1y underst00d. FiVe sing1e - gene mutati0ns resu1tir1g in 0besity haVe been described in mice , implicating genetic fact0rs in the eti010gy 0f 0besity. ( Friedman , j . m. , and Leibe1 , r. 1. Ce11 69 : 217 - 220 ( 1990 ) ) . In the 0b m0use a sing1e gene mutati0n , 0bese , resu1ts in pr0f0und 0besity , Which is acc0m - panied by diabetes ( Friedman , J. M. , et. a1. Gen0mics 11 : 1054 - 1062 ( 1991 ) ) . Cr0ss - circu1ati0n eXperiments haVe suggested that the 0b mice are deﬁcient 0f a b100d - b0me fact0r regu1ating nutrient intake and energy metab01ism ( C01eman , D. L. Diabet010gia 14 : 141 - 148 ( 1978 ) ) . Using p0siti0na1 c10ning techn010gies , the m0use 0b gene , and subsequent1y its human h0m010gue , haVe been recent1y c10ned ( Zhang , Y. , et. a1. , Nature 372 : 425 - 432 ( 1994 ) ) . Dai1y intraperit0nea1 inj ecti0ns 0f either m0use 0r human rec0mbinant OB pr0tein reduced the b0dy Weight 0f 0bese mice 0b / 0b by 30% after 2 Weeks 0f injecti0n. The pr0tein reduced f00d intake and increased energy eXpenditure in the 0b / 0b mice ( Ha1aas et. a1. , Science 269 : 543 - 546 ( 1995 ) ) . [ 0004 ] Cachexia 0n the 0ther hand is characterized by seVere Weight 10ss and imba1anced energy eXpenditure , eXamp1es being patients With cancer 0r HIV infecti0ns. [ 0005 ] The creatine kinase / creatine ph0sphate system is an energy generating system 0peratiVe pred0minant1y in the brain , musc1e , heart , retina , adip0se tissue and the kidney ( Wa11iman et. a1. , Bi0chem. J. 281 : 21 - 40 ( 1992 ) ) . The c0m - p0nents 0f the system inc1ude the enzyme creatine kinase ( CK ) , the substrates creatine ( Cr ) , creatine ph0sphate ( CrP ) , ATP , ADP , and the creatine transp0rter. The enzyme cata1yses. Dec. 3 , 2009. reVersib1y the transfer 0f a ph0sph0ry1 gr0up fr0m CrP t0 ADP t0 generate ATP Which is the main s0urce 0f energy in the ce11. This system represents the m0st efﬁcient Way t0 generate energy up0n rapid demand. The creatine kinase is0enzymes are f0und t0 be 10ca1ized at sites Where rapid rate 0f ATP rep1enishment is needed such as ar0und 10I1 channe1s and ATPase pumps. S0me 0f the functi0ns ass0ciated With this system inc1ude efﬁcient regenerati0n 0f energy in the f0rm 0f ATP in ce11s With ﬂuctuating and high energy demand , energy transp0rt t0 different parts 0f the ce11 , ph0s - ph0ry1 transfer actiVity , iOn transp0rt regu1ati0n , and inV01Vement in signa1transducti0n pathWays. [ 0006 ] The substrate Cr is a c0mp0und Which is natura11y 0ccurring and is f0und in mamma1ian brain , ske1eta1 musc1e , retina , adip0se tissue and the heart. Its ph0sph0ry1ated f0rm CrP is a1s0 f0und in the same 0rgans and is the pr0duct 0f the CK reacti0n. B0th c0mp0unds can be easi1y synthesized and are be1ieVed t0 be n0n t0Xic t0 man. A series 0f creatine ana10gues haVe a1s0 been synthesized and used as pr0bes t0 study the actiVe site 0f the enzyme. Kaddurah - Da0uk et a1. ( WO 92 / 08456 pub1ished May 29 , 1992 and WO 90 / 09192 , pub1ished Aug. 23 , 1990 ; US Pat. N0. 5 , 321 , 030 ; and US Pat.

These c0mp0unds are c011ectiVe1y referred t0 as “creatine c0mp0unds.”. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION. [ 0008 ] The present inVenti0n pr0Vides a meth0d 0f treating 0r preVenting a metab01ic dis0rder Which re1ates t0 an imba1 - ance in the regu1ati0n 0f b0dy Weight. EXamp1es W0u1d be 0besity and its re1ated dis0rders ( such as cardi0Vascu1ar disease , hypertensi0n , diabetes , hyper1ipidaemia , 0ste0p0r0sis and 0ste0arthritis ) and seVere Weight 10ss. It c0nsists 0f administering t0 a patient susceptib1e t0 0r eXperiencing said dis0rder a creatine c0mp0und ( creatine ana10gues and c0m - p0unds Which m0du1ate 0ne 0r m0re 0f the structura1 0r functi0na1 c0mp0nents 0f the creatine kinase / creatine ph0s - phate system ) as therapeutic in the f0rm 0f a pharmac010gi - ca11y acceptab1e sa1t as the pharmaceutica1 agent effectiVe t0 treat 0r preVent the disease 0r c0nditi0n. [ 0009 ] Obesity is the resu1t 0f a p0sitiVe energy ba1ance , as a c0nsequence 0f an increased rati0 0f ca10ric intake t0 energy expenditure Whi1e seVere Weight 10ss is a resu1t 0f a negatiVe energy ba1ance. The creatine kinase system is kn0Wn t0 be inV01Ved in energy metab01ism and its substrates creatine ph0sphate , and ATP are am0ng the highest energy c0m - p0unds in the ce11. It is n0W p0ssib1e t0 m0dify this system and. US 2009 / 0298943 A1. come up With comp0unds that can change energy ba1ance and subsequent1y treat , preVent or ame1i0rate the diseases mentioned. One can increase energy state or decrease it by using substrates or inhibitors for the enzyme creatine kinase , or modu1ators of the enzyme system ( compounds Which modify any 0f its c0mp0nents ) such as the creatine transp0rter. [ 0010 ] The present inVention a1so proVides comp0sitions containing creatine compounds in combination With a pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e carrier. A1so , they cou1d be used in combination With effectiVe amounts of standard chemotherapeutic agents Which act 0n regu1ating b0dy Weight and 0thers to prophy1actica11y and / or therapeutica11y treat a subject With a disease re1ated to body Weight c0ntro1. [ 0011 ] Packaged drugs for treating subjects haVing energy imba1ance resu1ting in Weight 10ss or gain are a1so the subject 0f the present inVention. The packaged drugs inc1ude a c0n - tainer ho1ding the creatine c0mpound , in combinati0n With a pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e carrier , a10ng With instructions for administering the same for the purpose of preVenting , ame1iorating , arresting or e1iminating a disease re1ated to g1uc0se 1eVe1regu1ati0n. [ 0012 ] By treatment is meant the ame1i0ration 0r tota1 aV0idance of the metabo1ic disorder as described herein. By preVention is meant the aVoidance of a current1y recognized disease state , as described herein , in a patient eVidencing some 0r a11 of the metabo1ic disorders described ab0Ve. [ 0013 ] F0r a11 of these purp0ses , any c0nVenient route 0f systemic administration is emp1oyed , e. g. , ora11y , parenter - a11y , intranasa11y or intrarecta11y. The aboVe compositions may be administered in a sustained re1ease f0rmu1ation. By sustained re1ease is meant a f0rmu1ation in Which the drug becomes bio1ogica11y aVai1ab1e to the patient at a measured rate oVer a pro10nged period. Such compositions are We11 knoWn in the art. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION. [ 0014 ] The method of the present inVention genera11y c0m - prises administering to an indiVidua1 afﬂicted With a disease or susceptib1e to a disease inV01Ving body Weight regu1ation , an amount of a comp0und or comp0unds Which m0du1ate one or more of the structura1 or functiona1 components of the creatine kinase / pho sphocreatine system sufﬁcient to preVent , reduce or ame1iorate symptoms 0f the disease. Components of the system Which can be m0du1ated inc1ude the enzyme creatine kinase , the substrates creatine , creatine ph0sphate , ADP , ATP , and the transporter of creatine. As used herein , the term “m0du1ate” means to change , affect or interfere With the functioning of the components in the creatine kinase / creatine phosphate enzyme system. [ 0015 ] The creatine kinase / creatine phosphate system is an energy generating system operatiVe predominant1y in the brain , musc1e , heart , retina , adip0se tissue and the kidney ( Wa11iman et. a1. , Biochem. J. 281 : 21 - 40 ( 1992 ) ) . The c0m - ponents of the system inc1ude the enzyme creatine kinase ( CK ) , the substrates creatine ( Cr ) , creatine phosphate ( CrP ) , ATP , ADP , and the creatine transporter. The enzyme cata1yses reVersib1y the transfer of a phosphory1 group fr0m CrP t0 ADP t0 generate ATP Which is the main source of energy in the ce11. This system represents the most efficient Way to generate energy upon rapid demand. The creatine kinase isoenzymes are found to be 10ca1ized at sites Where rapid rate of ATP rep1enishment is needed such as around ion channe1s and ATPase pumps. S0me 0f the functi0ns associated With this system inc1ude efﬁcient regeneration of energy in the. Dec. 3 , 2009. form of ATP in ce11s With ﬂuctuating and high energy demand , energy transport to different parts of the ce11 , phosphory1 transfer actiVity , ion transport regu1ation , and inVo1Vement in signa1 transduction pathWays. [ 0016 ] BroWn and White adipose tissue both c0ntain creatine kinase and the substrates creatine and creatine phosphate , With actiVity of the enzyme 50 times higher in broWn tissue ( Bert1et et a1. , Bi0chim Bi0phys. Acta 437 : 166 - 174 ( 1976 ) ) . Br0Wn fat tissue is resp0nsib1e for energy eXpenditure and heat generation thr0ugh the process of n0n - shiVering thermogenesis. It Was suggested that creatine may be inVo1Ved in co - promoting mitochondria1 respiration for thermogenesis. [ 0017 ] The substrate Cr is a comp0und Which is natura11y occurring and is found in mamma1ian brain , ske1eta1 musc1e , retina and the heart. Its phosphory1ated form CrP is a1so found in the same organs and is the product of the CK reaction. Both c0mpounds can be easi1y synthesized and are be1ieVed t0 be n0n t0Xic to man. A series 0f creatine ana1ogues haVe a1so been synthesized and used as probes t0 study the actiVe site of the enzyme. Kaddurah - Daouk et a1. ( WO 92 / 08456 pub1ished May 29 , 1992 and WO 90 / 09192 , pub - 1ishedAug. 23 , 1990 ; U. S. Pat. No. 5 , 321 , 030 ; and U. S. Pat. N0. 5 , 324 , 731 ) described meth0ds f0r inhibiting gr0Wth , transformation , or metastasis of mamma1ian ce11s using re1ated compounds. EXamp1es of such compounds inc1ude cyc10creatine , homocyc10creatine and beta guanidino pr0pionic acid. These same inVentors haVe a1so dem0nstrated the eﬁicacy 0f such comp0unds f0r c0mbating Vira1 infections ( U. S. Pat. No. 5 , 321 , 030 ) . E1geba1y in U. S. Pat. N0. 5 , 091 , 404 disc1oses the use of cyc1ocreatine for restoring function - a1ity in musc1e tissue. C0hn in PCT pub1icati0n N0. W094 / 166 87 describes a method for inhibiting the grthh 0f seVera1 tumors using creatine and re1ated compounds. [ 0018 ] The term “creatine comp0und” Wi11 be used herein to inc1ude creatine , and c0mpounds Which are structura11y simi1ar to it and ana1ogues of creatine and creatine phosphate. The term “creatine comp0und” a1s0 inc1udes c0mpounds Which “mimic” the actiVity of creatine , creatine ph0 sphate , or creatine ana1ogues i. e. , c0mp0unds Which modu1ate the creatine kinase system. The term “mimics” is intended t0 inc1ude comp0unds Which may not be structura11y simi1ar to creatine but mimic the therapeutic actiVity of the creatine ana1ogues or structura11y simi1ar compounds. The term creatine c0m - pounds Wi11 a1s0 inc1ude inhibit0rs of creatine kinase , ie. comp0unds Which inhibit the actiVity 0f the enzyme creatine kinase , mo1ecu1es that inhibit the creatine transp0rter or mo1 - ecu1es that inhibit the binding of the enzyme to 0ther structura1 proteins or enzymes or 11pids. The term “modu1at0rs” of the creatine kinase system” are compounds Which modu1ate the actiVity of the enzyme , or the actiVity 0f the transporter of creatine , or the abi1ity of the enzyme to associate With other ce11u1ar comp0nents. These cou1d be substrates f0r the enzyme and they Wou1d haVe the abi1ity to bui1d in their phosphory1ated state intrace11u1ar1y. These types of mo1 - ecu1es are a1so inc1uded in our term creatine comp0unds. The term creatine “ana1ogue” is intended to inc1ude compounds Which are structura11y simi1ar to creatine , compounds Which are art - recognized as being ana1ogues of creatine , and / or comp0unds Which share the same function as creatine. [ 0019 ] Creatine ( 0. a1so knoWn as N - ( aminoiminomethy1 ) - N - methy1 g1ycine ; methy1g1ycosamine or N - methy1 - guanidin0 acetic acid is a We11 - kn0Wn substance.

B0th creatine and creatine phosphate ( phosphocreatine ) can be extracted from anima1s or tissue or synthesized chemica11y. Both are commercia11y aVai1ab1e. [ 0020 ] Cyc1ocreatine is an essentia11y p1aner cyc1ic ana - 10gue of creatine. A1though cyc1ocreatine is structura11y simi - 1ar to creatine , the tWo compounds are distinguishab1e both kinetica11y and thermodynamica11y.
