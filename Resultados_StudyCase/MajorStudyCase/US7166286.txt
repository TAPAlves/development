In spite 0f numer0us adVances in medica1 research , cancer remains the sec0nd 1eading cause 0f death in the United States. In the industria1ized nati0ns , r0ugh1y 0ne in ﬁVe pers0ns Wi1l die 0f cancer. Traditi0nal m0des 0f c1inica1 care , such as surgicaI resecti0n , radi0therapy and chem0therapy , haVe a signiﬁcant fai1ure rate , especial1y f0r sO1id tum0rs. Fai1ure 0ccurs either because the initia1 tum0r is unresp0n - siVe , 0r because 0f recurrence due t0 regr0Wth at the 0rigina1 site and / 0r metastases. EVen in cancers such as breast cancer Where the m0rta1ity rate has decreased , successfuI interVen - ti0n re1ies 0n ear1y detecti0n 0f the cancer0us ce11s. The eti010gy , diagn0sis and ab1ati0n 0f cancer remain a centra1 f0cus f0r medica1 research and deVe10pment. Ne0p1asia resu1ting in benign tum0rs can usua11y be c0mp1ete1y cured by rem0Ving the mass surgica11y. If a tum0r bec0mes ma1ignant , as manifested by inVasi0n 0f surr0unding tissue , it bec0mes much m0re difficuIt t0 eradicate. Once a maIignant tum0r metastasizes , it is much Iess 1ike1y t0 be eradicated. The three maj0r cancers , in terms 0f m0rbidity and m0rtaIity , are c010n , breast and Iung. NeW surgicaI pr0cedures 01fer an increased surViVa1 rate f0r c010n cancer. Impr0Ved screening meth0ds increase the detecti0n 0f breast cancer , a110Wing ear1ier , 1ess aggressiVe therapy. Numer0us studies haVe sh0Wn that earIy detecti0n increases surViVaI and treatment 0pti0ns. Lung cancer remains 1arger refrac - t0ry t0 treatment. EXcIuding basa1 ceI1 carcin0ma , there are 0Ver 0ne miI1i0n neW cases 0f cancer per year in the United States aI0ne , and cancer acc0unts f0r 0Ver 0ne ha1f mi11i0n deaths per year in this c0untry. In the W0r1d as a Wh01e , the ﬁVe m0st c0mm0n cancers are th0se 0f 1ung , st0mach , breast , c010n / rectum , and uterine cerViX , and the t0taI number 0f neW cases per year is 0Ver 6 miIIi0n. OnIy ab0ut half the number 0f pe0pIe Wh0 deVe10p cancer die 0f it. Me1an0ma is 0ne 0f the human diseases f0r Which there is an acute need 0f neW therapeutic m0da1ities. It is a particular1y aggressiVe f0rm 0f skin cancer , and cccurs in increased frequency in indiViduaIs With reguIar unguarded sun eXp0sure. In the ear1y disease phases , melan0ma is charactenzed by pr01iferati0n at the derma1 - epiderma1 junc - ti0n , Which s00n inVades adjacent tissue and metastasizes Wide1y. Once it has metastasized , it is 0ften imp0ssib1e t0 eXtirpate and is c0nsequent1y fata1. W0rIdWide , 70 , 000 patients are diagn0sed With melan0ma and it is resp0nsib1e f0r 25 , 000 rep0rted deaths each year. The American Cancer. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 2. Society pr0jects that by the year 2000 , 1 0ut 0f eVery 75 Ame1icans Wi11 be diagn0sed With melan0ma. Neur0b1ast0ma is a higth ma1ignant tum0r 0ccurring during infancy and ear1y chi1dh00d. EXcept f0r Wi1ms tum0r , it is the m0st 00mm0n retr0perit0nea1 tum0r in cbi1dren. This tum0r metastasizes ear1y , With Widespread inV01Vement 0f 1ymph n0des , 1iVer , b0ne , 1ung , and marr0W. Whi1e the primary tum0r is res01Vab1e by resecti0n , the recurrence rate is high. An estimated 178 , 100 neW cases 0f 1ung cancer Wi11 be diagn0sed in 1997 , acc0unting f0r 13% 0f cancer diagn0ses. An estimated 160 , 400 deaths due t0 1ung cancer Wi11 0ccur in 1997 acc0unting f0r 29% 0f al1 cancer deaths. The 0ne year surViVa1 rates f0r1ung cancer haVe increased fr0m 32% in 1973 t0 41% in 1993 , 1arge1y due to impr0Vements in surgicaI techniques. The 5 year surViVaI rate f0r a1I stages c0mbined is 0n1y 14%. The surviVa1 rate is 48% f0r cases detected When the disease is sti11 10ca1ized , but 0n1y 15% 0f 1ung cancers are disc0Vered that ear1y. Sma11 ce1l 1ung cancer is the m0st ma1ignant and fastest gr0Wing f0rm 0f Iung cancer and acc0unts f0r 2 ( L25% 0f neW cases 0f 1ung cancer. 60 , 000 cases Wi11 be diagn0sed in the U. S. in 1996. The primary tum0r is genera11y resp0nsiVe t0 chem0therapy , but is f0110Wed by Wide - spread metastasis. The median surViVa1 time at diagn0sis is appr0Ximate1y 1 year , With a 5 year surViVa1 rate 0f 57I0%. Breast cancer is 0ne 0f the m0st c0mm0n cancers and is the third 1eading cause 0f death fr0m cancers in the United States With an annua1 incidence 0f ab0ut 180 , 200 neW cases am0ng W0men in the United States during 1997.

The 0Vera11 m0rta1ity rate f0r breast cancer has remained unchanged since 1930. It has increased an aVerage 0f 0.2% per year , but decreased in W0men under 65 years 0f age by an aVerage 0f 0.3% per year. PreIiminary data suggest that breast cancer m0rta1ity may be beginning t0 decrease , pr0b - ab1y as a resu1t 0f increased diagn0ses 0f 10ca1ized cancer and carcin0ma in situ. See e. g. , Marchant ( 1994 ) C0ntem - p0rary Management 0f Breast Disease II : Breast Cancer , in : ObStetricS and Gynec0 / 0gy CliniCS 0f N0rth AmeriCa 21 : 555—560 ; and C01ditZ ( I993 ) Cancer Supp / . 71 : 1480—1489. An estimated 44 , 190 deaths ( 43 , 900 W0men , 290 men ) in 1997 Wi1I 0ccur due t0 breast cancer. In W0men , it is the sec0nd maj 0r cause 0f cancer death after Iung cancer. The ﬁVe - year surViVa1 rate f0r 10ca1ized breast cancer has increased fr0m 72% in the 1940s t0 97% t0day. If the cancer has spread regi0na11y , h0WeVer , the rate is 76% , and f0r W0men With distant metastases the rate is 20%.

The increase is due in part t0 the increasing preVa1ence 0f 1ymph0mas in the AIDS patient p0pu1ati0n. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 3. C0l0n and rectal cancer Will acc0unt f0r an estimated l3l , 200 cases in l997 , including 94 , 100 0f c010n cancer and 37 , l 00 0f rectal cancer. C0l0rectal cancers acc0unt f0r ab0ut 9% 0f neW cancer diagn0ses. An estimated 54 , 900 deaths due to c010rectal cancer Will 0ccur in 1997 , acc0unting f0r ab0ut 10% 0f cancer deaths. M0rtality rates f0r c010rectal cancer haVe fallen 32% f0r W0men and 14% f0r men during the past 20 years , reﬁecting decreasing incidence rates and increasing surViVal rates. HOWeVer , the m0rtality rate in African American men c0ntinues to rise. The 1 and 5 year relatiVe surViVal rates f0r patients With c010n and rectal cancer are 82% and 6l% , respectiVely. When c010rectal cancers are detected in an early , localized stage , the 5 year surViVal rate is 9l% ; h0WeVer , 0nly 37% 0f c010rectal cancers are disc0Vered at that stage. After the cancer has spread regi0nally t0 inV0lVe adjacent 0rgans 0r lymph n0des , the rate dr0ps t0 63%. SurViVal rates f0r pers0ns With distant metastases is 7%. SurViVal c0ntinues t0 decline bey0nd 5 years , and 50% surViVe lO years. In spite 0f the diﬁiculties , effectiVe cures using anticancer drugs ( al0ne 0r in c0mbinati0n With 0ther treatments ) haVe been deVised f0r s0me f0rmerly highly lethal cancers. M0st n0table am0ng these are H0dgkins lymph0ma , testicular cancer , ch0ri0carcin0ma , and sOme leukemias and 0ther cancers 0f childh00d. F0r seVeral 0f the m0re c0mm0n cancers , early diagn0sis , appr0priate surgery 0r local radi0 - therapy enables a large pr0p0rti0n 0f patients t0 rec0Ver. Current meth0ds 0f cancer treatment are relatiVely n0n - selectiVe. Surgery rem0Ves the diseased tissue , radi0therapy shrinks s0lid tum0rs and chem0therapy kills rapidly diViding cells. Chem0therapy , in particular , results in numer0us side effects , in sOme cases SO seVere t0 preclude the use 0f p0tentially eﬁectiVe drugs. M0re0Ver , cancers 0ften deVel0p resistance t0 chem0therapeutic drugs. Numer0us e1f0rts are being made t0 enhance the speci - ﬁcity 0f cancer therapy.

In particular , identiﬁca - ti0n 0f cell surface antigens eXpressed eXclusiVely 0r preferentially 0n certain tum0rs all0Ws the f0rmulati0n 0f m0re selectiVe treatment strategies. Antib0dies directed t0 these antigens haVe been used in immun0therapy 0f seVeral types 0f cancer. The basic immun0gl0bulin ( Ig ) structural unit in Vertebrate systems is c0mp0sed 0f tW0 identical light ( “L” ) p0lypeptide chains ( appr0Ximately 23 kDa ) , and tW0 identical heaVy ( “H” ) chains ( appr0Ximately 53 t0 70 kDa ) . The f0ur chains are j0ined by disulﬁde b0nds in a “Y” c0nﬁgurati0n. At the base 0f the Y , the tW0 H chains are b0und by 00Valent disulﬁde linkages. FIG. 1 sh0Ws a schematic 0f an antib0dy structure. The L and H chains are each c0mp0sed 0f a Variable ( V ) regi0n at the N - terminus , and a c0nstant ( C ) regi0n at the C - tenninus. In the L chain , the V regi0n ( termed “VLJL” ) is 00mp0sed 0f a V ( VL ) regi0n c0nnected thr0ugh the j0ining ( J L ) regi0n t0 the C regi0n ( C L ) . In the H chain , the V regi0n ( VHDHJH is c0mp0sed 0f a Variable ( VH ) regi0n linked thr0ugh a c0m - binati0n 0f the diVersity ( DH ) regi0n and the j0ining ( J H ) regi0n to the C regi0n ( C H ) . The VLJL and V HD HJ H regi0ns 0f the L and H chains , respectiVely , are ass0ciated at the tips 0f the Y t0 f0rm the antigen binding p0rti0n and determine antigen binding speciﬁcity. The ( CH ) regi0n deﬁnes the is0type , i. e. , the class 0r subclass 0f antib0dy. Antib0dies 0f different is0types diﬁer. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 4. muc0sal and placental barriers , and f0rm p0lymers 0f the basic f0ur - chain IgG m0lecule. Antib0dies are categ0rized int0 “classes” acc0rding t0 the C H type utilized in the immun0gl0bulin m0lecule ( I gM , IgG , IgD , IgE , 0r IgA ) . There are at least ﬁVe types 0f CH genes ( Cu , Cy , C6 , Ce , and C01 ) , and s0me species haVe multiple CH subtypes ( e. g. , Cyl , Cy2 , CV3 , and CV4 , in humans ) . There are a t0tal 0f nine CH genes in the hapl0id gen0me 0f humans , eight in m0use and rat , and seVeral feWer in many 01her species. In c0ntrast , there are n0rmally 0nly tW0 types 0f L chain C regi0ns ( CL ) , kappa ( K ) and lambda ( A ) , and 0nly 0ne 0f these C regi0ns is present in a single L chain pr0tein ( i. e. , there is 0nly 0ne p0ssible L chain C regi0n f0r eVery VLJL pr0duced ) . Each H chain class can be ass0ciated With either 0f the L chain classes ( e. g. , a C HY regi0n can be present in the same antib0dy as either a K 0r K L chain ) , alth0ugh the C regi0ns 0f the H and L chains Within a particular class d0 n0t Vary With antigen speciﬁcity ( e. g. , an IgG antib0dy alWays has a Cy H chain C regi0n regardless 0f the antigen speciﬁcity ) . Each 0f the V , D , J , and C regi0ns 0f the H and L chains are enc0ded by distinct gen0mic sequences. Antib0dy diVersity is generated by rec0mbinati0n betWeen the diﬁerent VH , DH , and JH , gene segments in the H chain , and VL and JL gene segments in the L chain. The rec0mbinati0n 0f the dilferent VH , DH , and JH genes is acc0mplished by DNA rec0mbinati0n during B cell differentiati0n. Brieﬁy , the H chain sequence rec0mbines ﬁrst t0 generate a DHJH c0m - pleX , and then a sec0nd rec0mbinat0rial eVent pr0duces a VHDHJH c0mplex. A ﬁincti0nal H chain is pr0duced up0n transcripti0n f0ll0Wed by splicing 0f the RNA transcript. Pr0ducti0n 0f a functi0nal H chain triggers rec0mbinati0n in the L chain sequences t0 pr0duce a rearranged VLJL regi0n Which in turn f0rms a functi0nal VLJLCL regi0n , i. e. , the ﬁincti0nal L chain. The Value and p0tential 0f antib0dies as diagn0stic and therapeutic reagents has been lOng - rec0gnized in the art. Unf0rtunately , the ﬁeld has been hampered by the sl0W , tedi0us pr0cesses required t0 pr0duce large quantities 0f an antib0dy 0f a desired speciﬁcity. The classical cell ﬁ1si0n techniques all0Wed f0r eﬁicient pr0ducti0n 0f Mabs by fusing the B cell pr0ducing the antib0dy With an imm0rtalized cell line. The resulting cell line is a hybrid0ma cell line. Antib0dies and functi0nal deriVatiVes there0f haVe been used in a Variety 0f clinical settings. F0r instance , dig0Xinspeciﬁc Fab antib0dy fragments Were used t0 treat lifethreatening digitalis int0Xicati0n. Antib0dies are bec0ming m0re r0utinely useful in diagn0stic techniques such as radi0immune diagn0sis 0f c010n cancers. K0da et al. ( l995 ) . 50 Am. J. Gastmentero / 90 : 1644.

A number 0f aut0antib0dies ( antib0dies that rec0gnize and bind t0 self antigens ) are f0und in humans. Many 0f these are ass0ciated With particular diseases such as rheumat0id arthritis , systemic lupus erythemat0sus , myasthenia graVis , primary biliary cirrh0sis , p0lymy0sitis , systemic Vasculitis , idi0pathic necr0tizing and crescentic gl0merul0 - nephritis and amy0tr0phic lateral scler0sis.

This inVenti0n enc0mpasses c0mp0siti0ns c0ntaining antigen binding fragments 0f an antib0dy Where the anti - b0dy speciﬁcally rec0gnizes the antigen rec0gnized by an antib0dy c0mprising a H chain V regi0n haVing the amin0 acid sequence 0f SEQ ID NO : 2 and a L chain V regi0n haVing the amin0 acid sequence 0f SEQ ID NO : 4. Preferably , the antib0dy is Hll. The inVenti0n ﬁ1rther enc0m - passes antib0dies c0mprising the H and L chain V regi0ns 0f Hll ( SEQ ID NOS : 2 and 4 , respectiVely ) . Hll speciﬁcally rec0gnizes cancer cells fr0m a Wide Variety 0f cancers but d0es n0t rec0gnize n0rmal , n0n - cancer0us cells. By “d0es n0t rec0gnize” is meant that n0ncancer cells are either n0t speciﬁcally b0und t0 by Hll 0r are 0nly p00rly rec0gnized by the antib0dy. The antib0dies are designated 01C and include Hll and any antib0dy With the “immun0l0gic speci - ﬁcity” 0f Hl 1 , that is , rec0gnizing the antigen rec0gnized by H11 , and that is speciﬁc f0r at least 0ne type 0f cancer cell but d0es n0t rec0gnize n0rmal cells.

A “signal peptide” or “leader sequence” is a short amino acid sequence that directs a nery synthesized protein through a cellular membrane , usually the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells , and either the inner membrane or both inner and 0uter membranes 0f bacteria Signal peptides are typically at the N - terminal portion of a polypeptide and are typically remoVed enzymatically betWeen biosynthesis and secretion 0f the p0lypeptide fr0m the cell. The signal peptide is not present in the secreted protein , only during protein producti0n. An “isolated” polynucleotide or polypeptide is one that is substantially free of the materials With Which it is associated in its natiVe enVir0nment. By substantially free is meant at least 50% , preferably at least 70% , more preferably at least 80% , and eVen more preferably at least 90% free of these materials. A “stable duplex” of polynucleotides , or a “stable complex” formed betWeen any tWo or more components in a biochemical reacti0n , refers to a duplex or complex that is suﬁiciently long - lasting to persist betWeen the f0rmation of the duplex or complex and subsequent detection , including any optional Washing steps or other manipulation that may take place in the interim. A “biological sample” encompasses a Variety of sample types , including blood and other liquid samples of biological origin , solid tissue samples such as a biopsy specimens or tissue cultures , or cells deriVed therefrom and the progeny thereof. The deﬁnition also includes samples that haVe been manipulated in any Way after their procurement , such as by treatment With reagents , solubilization , or enrichment for certain components , such as proteins or polynucleotides. The term encompasses Various kinds of clinical samples obtained from any species , and als0 includes cells in culture , cell supematants , and cell lysates. Particularly , for the purposes described herein , biological samples comprise tumor tissue or tissue thought to be tumorous and are obtained for instance by surgical resection , biopsy , aspiration or any method knoWn in the art. An “immunogen” refers to compositi0n for human or animal use , Which is administered With the intention of conferring to the recipient a degree of speciﬁc immunologic reactiVity against a particular antigen. The immunologic reactiVity may be carried out by antibodies or cells ( particularly B cells , plasma cells , T helper cells , and cyt0toxic T lymphocytes , and their precursors ) that are immunologically reactiVe against the target , or any combination thereof. For purposes of this inVention , the target is primarily tumorassociated C antigen or a tumor - speciﬁc portion thereof. The immunologic reactiVity may be desired f0r experimental purposes , for treatment of a particular conditi0n , for the elimination of a particular substance , or for prophylaxis. An actiVe immunogen is intended to elicit an immune response that persists in the absence of the Vaccine components. “AdjuVant” as used herein has seVeral meanings , all of Which Will be clear depending on the context in Which the term is used. In the context 0f a pharmaceutical preparati0n , an adjuVant is a chemical or biological agent giVen in combination With or recombinantly fused to an antigen to enhance immunogenicity of the antigen. In the context of cancer diagnosis or management , adjuVant refers to a class of cancer patients With no clinically detectable tumor mass , but Who are suspected of being at risk of recurrence. When referring to a type of cancer that normally manifests as a solid tumor , a “clinically detectable” tumor is one that is detectable on the basis of tumor mass ; i. e. , by such. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 14. procedures as CAT scan , X - Ray , or palpation. Biochemical , histological or immunologic ﬁndings alone may be insuﬂi - cient to meet this deﬁnition. As used herein , “treatment” refers to clinical interVenti0n in an attempt to alter the natural course of the indiVidual or cell being treated , and may be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course 0f clinical path0logy. Desirable e1fects of the treatment include preVenting occurrence or recurrence of disease , alleViation of symptoms , diminishment of any direct or indirect path0logical c0nsequences of the disease , preVenting metastasis , decreasing the rate of disease progression , amelioration or palliation of the disease state , and remission or improVed pr0gnosis. The “pathology” associated With a disease condition is any conditi0n that compromises the Well - being , normal physi0logy , or quality of life of the aﬁected indiVidual. This may inVolVe , but is not limited to , destructiVe inVasion of aﬁected tissues into preViously unaﬁected areas , gr0Wth at the expense of normal tissue function , irregular or suppressed biological actiVity , aggraVation or suppression of an inﬁammatory or immunol0gic resp0nse , increased susceptibility to other pathogenic organisms or agents , and undesirable clinical symptoms such as pain , feVer , nausea , fatigue , mood alterations , and such other features as may be determined by an attending physician. An “effectiVe am0unt” is an amount suﬁicient to eﬁect a beneﬁcial or desired clinical result. An eﬁectiVe amount can be administered in one or more doses. In terms of treatment , an effectiVe amount is amount that is suﬁicient to palliate , ameliorate , stabilize , reVerse or sloW the progression of the disease , or otherWise reduce the pathological c0nsequences of the disease. In terms of an adjuVant , an effectiVe amount is one suﬁicient to enhance the immune response to the immunogen. The eﬁectiVe amount is generally determined by the physician 0n a case - by - case basis and is Within the skill of one in the art. SeVeral factors are typically taken into account When determining an appropriate dosage. These factors include age , sex and Weight of the patient , the conditi0n being treated , the seVerity of the condition and the form of the antibody being administered. For instance , the concentration of scFV need not be as high as that of natiVe antibodies in order to be therapeutically eﬁectiVe. An “indiVidual” , “patient” or “subject” is a Vertebrate , preferably a mammal , more preferably a human. Mammals include , but are n0t limited t0 , humans , farm animals , sp0rt animals , and pets. The practice of the present inVention employs , unless otherWise indicated , conVentional techniques of molecular biology ( including recombinant techniques ) , microbiology , cell biology , biochemistry and immunology , Which are Within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained ﬁilly in the literature , such as , “M0lecular Cl0ning : A Laboratory Manual” , second edition ( Sambrook et al. , l989 ) ; “Oligonucleotide Synthesis” ( M. J. Gait , ed. , 1984 ) ; “Animal Cell Culture” ( R. I. Freshney , ed. , 1987 ) ; “Methods in Enzym0logy” ( Academic Press , Inc. ) ; “Handbook of Experimental Immun0l0gy” ( D. M. Wei & C. C.

C are useful , for example , in detection systems such as quantitation of tumor burden , and imaging of metastatic foci and tumor imaging. Such labels are knoWn in the art and include , but are not limited to , radi0is0t0pes , enzymes , ﬁuorescent compounds , chemiluminescent compounds , bioluminescent compounds substrate cofactors and inhibitors. See , for examples of patents teaching the use of such labels , U. S. Pat. N0s. 3 , 8l7 , 837 ; 3 , 850 , 752 ; 3 , 939 , 350 ; 3 , 996 , 345 ; 4 , 277 , 437 ; 4 , 275 , 149 ; and 4 , 366 , 241. The m0i - eties may be coValently linked to ( 1C , recombinantly linked , or conjugated to the 0C through a secondary reagent , such as a second antibody , protein A , or a biotin - aVidin complex. Other ﬁinctional moieties include signal peptides , agents that enhance immunol0gic reactiVity , agents that facilitate coupling to a solid support , Vaccine carriers , bioresponse modiﬁers , paramagnetic labels and drugs. Signal peptides are described aboVe and include prokaryotic and eukaryotic forms. Agents that enhance immunologic reactiVity include , but are not limited to , bacterial superantigens. Agents that facilitate coupling to a solid support include , but are not limited to , biotin or aVidin. Immunogen carriers include , but are not limited to , any physiologically acceptable buﬁers. Bioresponse m0diﬁers include cytokines , particularly tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin - 2 , interleukin - 4 , granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and Y interferons. Suitable drug moieties include antineoplastic agents.

Immunotoxins , including single chain molecules , can be produced by recombinant means. Production of Various immunotoxins is Well - knoWn in the art , and methods can be found , for example , in “Monoclonal Antibody - toxin Conjugates : Aiming the Magic Bullet , ” Thorpe et al. ( l982 ) M0n0cl0nal Antib0dies in Clinical Medicine , Academic Press , pp. 168—190 ; Vitatta ( 1987 ) Science 238 : 1098—1104 ; and Winter and Milstein ( 1991 ) Natare 349 : 293—299. Suitable toxins include , but are not limited to , ricin , radionuclides , pokeWeed antiViral protein , Pseud0rn0nas exotoxin A , diphtheria t0xin , ricin A chain , fungal t0xins such as restrictocin and phospholipase enzymes. See , generally , “Chimeric Toxins , ” Olsnes and Pihl , Pharmac. T her. lS : 355738l ( 1981 ) ; and “Monoclonal Antibodies for Cancer Detection and Therapy , ” eds. BaldWin and Byers , pp. lS9—179 , 224—266 , Academic Press ( l985 ) . The chemically functi0nal m0ieties can be made rec0m - binantly for instance by creating a ﬁ1sion gene encoding the antigen binding fragment and functional regions from other genes ( e. g. enzymes ) . In the case of gene fusions , the tWo components are present Within the same polypeptide gene. AltematiVely , the ( 1C antigen binding fragments can be. 5. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 16. cross linkers , e. g. , SPDP , carbodiimide glutaraldehyde , or the like. The moieties may be coValently linked , or conjugated , through a secondary - reagent , such as a second antibody , protein A , or a biotin - aVidin complex. Paramagnetic m0ieties and the conjugation thereof to antib0dies are WellknoWn in the art. See , e. g. , Miltenyi et al. ( 1990 ) Cyt0metry 11 ; 231 , 23g_. The o. C antibody of this inVention can be prepared in seVeral Ways. It is most conVeniently 0btained from cells engineered to express an antigen binding fragment containing SEQ ID NOS : 1 and 5 or other polynucleotides encoding ( 1C binding fragments. For example , the cells can be cultured in a suitable medium , and spent medium can be used as an antibody s0urce. Optionally , matrix - c0ated channels or beads and cell co - cultures may be included to enhance grthh of antibody - producing cells. For the production of large amounts of antibody , it is generally more conVenient to obtain an ascites ﬁuid. The method of raising ascites generally comprises injecting hybridoma cells int0 an immunol0gically naiVe histoc0mpatible or immun0tolerant mammal , especially a mouse. The mammal may be primed for ascites production by prior administration of a suitable composition ; e. g. , Pristane. AltematiVely , ( 1C can be chemically synthesized using sequence data and other informati0n proVided in this disclosure , in conjunction With standard methods of protein synthesis. A suitable method is the solid - phase Merriﬁeld technique. Automated peptide synthesizers are commercially aVailable , such as those manufactured by Applied Biosystems , Inc. ( Foster City , Calif. ) . ( 1C may also be obtained by employing routine recombinant methods such as described in Sambrook et al. ( 1989 ) . For instance , using the amino acid and polynucleotide ( SEQ ID NOS : l—6 , and l3—l8 ) sequences and inf0rmation proVided herein , a polynucleotide encoding either the 0C H or L chain can be cloned into a suitable expression Vector ( Which contains control sequences for transcription , such as a promoter ) . The expression Vect0r is in turn introduced into a host cell. The host cell is groWn under suitable conditions such that the polynucleotide is transcribed and translated into a protein. H and L chains of otC may be produced separately , and then c0mbined by disulﬁde bond rearrangement. AltematiVely , Vectors With separate polynucleotides encoding each chain of o : C , or a Vector With a single polynucleotide encoding both chains as separate transcripts , may be transfected into a single host cell Which may then produce and assemble the entire molecule. Preferably , the host cell is deriVed from a higher eukaryote that can pr0Vide the normal carbohydrate c0mplement of the molecule. The o. C thus produced can be puriﬁed using standard techniques in the art. Polynucleotides encoding o. C for use in the production of o. C can in turn be obtained from a hybridoma producing a CC antibody , or produced synthetically or rec0mbinantly from the DNA sequences proVided herein. Another method of obtaining CC is to immunize suitable host animals With C antigen and to folloW standard procedures for polyclonal or Mab production. Mabs thus produced can be “humanized” by meth0ds kn0Wn in the art. Examples of humanized antib0dies are proVided , for instance , in U. S. Pat. Nos. 5 , 530 , 101 and 5 , 585 , 089. “Humanized” antibodies are antibodies in Which at least part of the sequence has been altered from its initial form to render it m0re like human immunoglobulins. In 0ne Version , the H chain and L chain C regi0ns are replaced With human. chemically bonded to the moiety by any of a Variety of Well 65 sequence. This is a fusi0n polypeptide comprising a H11 V. knoWn chemical procedures. For example , When the moiety is a protein , the linkage may be by Way of heterobifunctional. region and a heterologous immunoglobulin C region. In another Version , the CDR regions comprise Hl1 amino acid. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 17. sequences , While the V frameWork regions haVe als0 been conVerted human sequences. See , for example , EP 0329400. In a third Version , V regions are humanized by designing consensus sequences of human and mouse V regions , and conVerting residues 0utside the CDRs that are different betWeen the consensus sequences. The inVention encompasses humanized Mabs. In making humanized antibodies , the choice of frameWork residues can be critical in retaining high binding aﬁinity. In principle , a frameWork sequence fr0m any HuAb can serVe as the template for CDR grafting ; hoWeVer , it has been demonstrated that straight CDR replacement into such a frameWork can lead to signiﬁcant loss of binding afﬁnity to the antigen. Glaser et al. ( 1992 ) J. lmman0l. l49 : 2606 ; Tempest et al. ( 1992 ) Bi0techn0l0gy 9 : 266 ; and Shalaby et al. ( 1992 ) J. Exp. Med. l7 : 217. The more homologous a HuAb is to the original muAb , the less likely that the human frameWork Will introduce distortions into the murine CDRs that could reduce aﬁinity. Based on a sequence hom0logy search against an antibody sequence database , the HuAb IC4 proVides good frameWork homology to muM4TS.22 , although other highly homologous HuAbs Would be suitable as Well , especially kappa L chains from human subgroup I or H chains fr0m human subgr0up III. Kabat et al. ( l987 ) . Various computer programs such as ENCAD ( LeVitt et al. ( 1983 ) J. M0l. Bi0l. 168 : 595 ) are aVailable to predict the ideal sequence for the V region. The inVention thus encompasses HuAbs With di1ferent V regions. It is Within the skill of 0ne in the art to determine suitable V region sequences and to optimize these sequences. Methods for obtaining antibodies With reduced immunogenicity are also described in U. S. Pat. No. 5 , 270 , 202 and EP 699 , 755. Methods of antibody production and isolation are Well knoWn in the art. See , f0r example , Harl0W and Lane ( l 988 ) Antib0dies : A Lab0rat07j7 Manaal , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , NeW York. The H1l antibody is a human immunoglobulin of the IgM subclass , and may be isolated by any technique suitable for immunoglobulins of this isotype. Puriﬁcation methods may include salt precipitation ( f0r example , With ammonium sulfate ) , ion exchange chromatography ( for example , on a cationic or anionic exchange column run at neutral pH and eluted With step gradients of increasing ionic strength ) , gel ﬁltration chromatography ( including gel ﬁltration HPLC ) , and chromatography on aﬁinity resins such as protein A , protein G , hydroxyapatite , and anti - immunoglobulin. Hl1 may also be puriﬁed on aﬁinity columns comprising the C antigen ; for example , in the form of a puriﬁed Abl or Ab3. Preferably , Hll is puriﬁed using Protein - A - CL - Sephar0seTM 4B chromatography f0l - loWed by chromatography 0n a DEAE - SepharoseTM 4B ion exchange column. The inVention also encompasses hybrid antibodies , in Which one pair 0f H and L chains is obtained from a ﬁrst antibody , While the other pair of H and L chains is obtained fr0m a different second antibody For purposes of this inVention , one pair of L and H chains is from ( 1C. In one example , each L - H chain pair binds diﬁerent epitopes of the C antigen. Such hybrids may also be formed using humanized H 0r L chains. Another 0. C contemplated by this inVention is an antibody in Which the H or L chain has been modiﬁed to proVide additional properties. For instance , a change in amino acid sequence can result in reduced immun0genicity of the resultant p0lypeptide. The changes range from changing of. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 18. action With membrane receptors , and other eﬁector functions. A recombinant antibody may also be designed to aid the speciﬁc deliVery of a substance ( such as a cytokine ) to a tumor cell. Als0 encompassed by the inVention are peptides in Which Various immunogl0bulin d0mains haVe been placed in an order other than that Which - occurs in nature. If ( 1C is to be administered to an indiVidual , it is preferably at least 80% pure , more preferably it is at least 90% pure , eVen more preferably it is at least 95% pure and free of pyrogens and 0ther c0ntaminants. In this context , the percent purity is calculated as a Weight percent of the total protein content of the preparation , and does not include constituents Which are deliberately added to the composition after the OtC is puriﬁed. The ( 1C antib0dies may be used f0r a number 0f purp0ses. These include eliciting an antibody response to produce dotC Which can then be used to elicit a T cell response to otC or the C antigen and treating Various types of cancer. These uses are elaborated m0re ﬁilly in a later section. The inVention encompasses polypeptide fragments 0f ( 1C containing at least a portion of a V region of ( 1C. Preferred fragments are those With the immunologic actiVity of Hl1. Also preferred are fragments Which comprise amino acid sequences substantially different from 0ther immun0globulins , and fragments c0mprising a CDR. In one embodiment , the inVention includes a polypeptide fragment of the ( 1C H chain V region , comprising at least 25 consecutiVe amino acids , more preferably 30 consecutiVe amino acids of SEQ ID NO : 2 , or 5 consecutiVe amino acids of the CDRl thereof , or at least 7 consecutiVe amino acids , preferably at least 9 consecutiVe amino acids of the CDR2 or CDR3 thereof. The inVention also includes a polypeptide fragment of the 0C L chain V region , comprising at least 25 consecutiVe amino acids , more preferably 30 consecutiVe amin0 acids of SEQ ID NO : 5 , or 7 consecutiVe amino acids of the CDR2 thereof , or at least 8 consecutiVe amino acids , preferably 10 consecutiVe amino acids of the CDR1 or CDR3 thereof. The size of the ( 1C polypeptides can be only the minimum size required to proVide a desired function. The polypeptides can optionally comprise additional sequence , either natiVe to o. C , or from a heterologous source , as desired , ( 1C peptides can c0ntain only 5 consecutiVe amino acids from a Hll V region sequence that are not the same as the homologous region of A6. Polypeptides comprising 7 amino acids , more preferably about lO amino acids , more preferably about 15 amino acids , more preferably about 25 amino acids , more preferably about 50 amino acids , more preferably about 75 amino acids from the ( 1C L or H chain V region are also included. EVen more preferred are p0lypeptides comprising the entire ( 1C L or H chain V region. Preferably the p0lypeptides are the scFVs depicted in ( SEQ ID NOS : 14 and 17. The inVention includes modiﬁed ( 1C polypeptides Which are functionally equiValent to H1l , or haVe altered but measurable H11 immunologic actiVity. M0diﬁed p0lypeptides With improVed H11 immunologic actiVity are preferred. Examples of modiﬁed polypeptides include those With conserVatiVe substitutions of amino acid residues , and one or m0re deletions or additi0ns of amin0 acids Which do n0t signiﬁcantly deleteriously alter the immun0logic actiVity. One example of this is Hl1 polypeptides comprising one or more amino acid substitution in comparison With the prot0type H11 sequence. Substitutions can range fr0m changing 0r modifying one 0r m0re amino acid residues to. one or more amino acids to the complete redesign of a region 65 complete redesign of a region , such as the V region. Amino. such as a C region domain. Typical changes include , but are not limited to , those related to complement ﬁxation , inter - . acid substitutions , if present , are preferably conserVatiVe substitutions that do not deleteriously affect folding or. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 19. functional properties of the peptide. Groups of functionally related amin0 acids Within Which c0nserVatiVe substitutions can be made are glycine / alanine ; Valine / isoleucine / leucine ; asparagine / glutamine ; aspartic acid / glutamic acid ; serine / thre0nine / methionine ; lysine / arginine ; and phenylaianine / tryosine / tryptophan. P0lypeptides of this inVenti0n can be in glycosylated or unglycosylated form , can be modiﬁed posttranslationally ( e. g. , acetylation , and phosphorylation ) or can be modiﬁed synthetically ( e. g. , the attachment of a labeling group ) . H11 polypeptide deriVatiVes c0mprising b0th a H11 L chain and a H11 H chain can be formed as separate L and H chains and then assembled , or assembled in situ by an expression system for both chains. Such expression systems can be created by transfecting a suitable cell With a plasmid comprising separate transcribable regions for the L and H chain , or by co - transfecting the same cell With plasmids for each chain. In a third method , a suitable plasmid With a H chain encoding region is transfected into a H chain loss mutant. H chain loss mutants can be obtained by treating approximately 2><107 H11 pr0ducing cells With ﬁu0rescein - labeled rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( H chain speciﬁc , DAKO Corporation , Carpinteria , Calif. ) according to the suppliers instruction. The stained and unstained cell populations are analyzed in a ﬁuorescence - actiVated cell sorter. The unstained cells are collected in a sterilized tube and placed in 96 - Well plates With 1 cell / Well by limiting dilution. The culture supernatants are then assayed by ELISA using goat anti - mouse IgG ( H chain speciﬁc ) and g0at anti - mouse kappa. The clones With kappa - positiVe and IgG - negatiVe phenotype are subcloned at least 3 times to obtain stable H11 ( ' H ) mutants. mRNA from putatiVe H chain loss mutant H1l ( ‘H ) clones can be isolated and the sequence of the L chain V region cDNA determined. ReVerse PCR of the mRNA f0r the Hll VH is performed With 2 sets of 5 ' - and 3 ' - primers , used for cloning of H11Her cDNA ( Example 7 ) . A H chain loss mutant yields no detectable DNA band. Transfection of the cells proceeds With a suitable H chain plasmid. Another ( 1C de1iVatiVe encompassed by this inVention is an antibody in Which the CC H or L chain has been modiﬁed to proVide additional properties. For instance , a change in amino acid sequence can result in greater immunogenicity of the resultant polypeptide. The changes range from changing of one or more amino acids to the complete redesign of a region such as a C region d0main. Changes contemplated aﬁect complement ﬁxation , interaction With membrane receptors , and other eﬁector functions. A recombinant H11 antibody can also be designed to aid the speciﬁc deliVery of a substance ( such as a lymphokine ) to an e1fector cell. Also encompassed by the inVenti0n are proteins in Which Various immunogl0bulin d0mains haVe been placed in an 0rder other than that Which occurs in nature. The inVention also encompasses single chain V region fragments ( “scFV” ) of H1 l. Single chain V region fragments are made by linking L and / or H chain V regions by using a short linking peptide. Bird et al. ( l988 ) Science 242 : 423—426. Any peptide haVing suﬁicient ﬁexibility and. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 20. All 0r any portion of the H or L chain can be used in any combination. Typically , the entire V regions are included in the scFV. For instance , the L chain V region can be linked to the H chain V region. AltematiVely , a p0rtion of the L chain V regi0n can be linked to the H chain V region , 0r a porti0n thereof. Also c0ntemplated are scFVs in Which the H chain V region is from H1l , and the L chain V region is from another immunoglobulin. It is also possible to construct a biphasic , scFV in Which one c0mponent is a H11 p0lypeptide and an0ther c0mponent is a diﬁerent polypeptide , such as a T cell epitope. The scFVs can be assembled in any order , for example , VH - ( linker ) - VL or VL - ( linker ) - VH. For example , SEQ ID NOS : l3 and 16 sh0W Hl l - scFV2 c0nstructs haVing the form VL - ( linker ) - VH. HOWeVer , the c0nstruct sh0Wn in SEQ ID NO : 13 forms monomers , While the construct shoWn in SEQ ID NO : l6 forms dimers. There may be a difference in the leVel of expression of these tWo conﬁgurations in particular expression systems , in Which case one of these forms may be preferred. Tandem scFVs can also be made , such as ( X ) - ( linker ) - ( X ) - ( linker ) - ( X ) , in Which X are ( 1C polypeptides , or combinations of 0C polypeptides With other polypeptides. In another embodiment , single chain antibody polypeptides haVe no linker p0lypeptide , or just a short , inﬁexible linker. Exemplary c0nﬁgurati0ns include VL—VH and VH7VL. The linkage is too short to permit interaction betWeen VL and VH Within the chair , and the chains form homodimers With a VL / VH antigen binding site at each end. Such m0lecules are referred to in the art as “diabodies”. ScFVs can be produced either recombinantly or synthetically. For synthetic production of scFV , an automated synthesizer can be used. For recombinant production of scFV , a suitable plasmid containing a polynucleotide that encodes the scFV can be introduced into a suitable h0st cell , either eukary0tic , such as yeast , plant , insect or mammalian cells , or prokaryotic , such as Escherichia c0li , and the protein expressed by the polynucleotide can be isolated using standard protein puriﬁcation techniques. A particularly useful system for the production of scFVs is plasmid pET - 22b ( + ) ( NoVagen , Madison , Wis. ) in E. c0li. pET - 22b ( + ) contains a nickel ion binding domain consisting of 6 sequential histidine residues , Which alloWs the expressed protein to be puriﬁed on a suitable afﬁnity resin. Another example of a suitable Vector is pcDNA3 ( InVitrogen , San Diego , Calif. ) , described aboVe. Expression conditions should ensure that the scFV assumes functional and , preferably , optimal tertiary structure. Depending on the plasmid used ( especially the actiVity of the pr0moter ) and the h0st cell , it may be necessary to modulate the rate of production. For instance , use of a Weaker promoter , or expression at loWer temperatures , may be necessary to optimize production of properly folded scFV in prokaryotic systems ; or , it may be preferably to express scFV in eukary0tic cells. Preferred scFV comprise at least 10 consecutiVe amino acids of SEQ. ID NO : 2 and at least lO consecutiVe amino acids of SEQ. ID NO : 5 , especially Wherein the amino acids of SEQ. ID NO : 2 and the amino acids 0f SEQ. ID NO : 5 are joined by a linker p0lypeptide 0f 5 to 20 amin0 acids , or. length can be used as a linker in a scFV. Usually the linker 60 comprising the L chain V region and the H chain V region. is selected to haVe little to no immunogenicity. An example of a linking peptide is ( GGGGS ) 3 , Which bridges approximately 3.5 nm betWeen the carboxy terminus of one V regi0n and the amino terminus of an0ther V region. Other. of H11. The inVention also encompasses polymeric forms of ( 1C polypeptides , containing a plurality of ( 1C p0lypeptides. One embodiment is a linear polymer of otC p0lypeptides , 0ption - . linker sequences can also be used , and can proVide addi - 65 ally conjugated to carrier. These linear polymers can c0m - . tional functions , such as a means for attaching a drug or a solid support. p1ise multiple copies of a single otC polypeptide , or combinations of di1ferent 0. C polypeptides , and can haVe tandem. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 21. CC polypeptides , or o. C polypeptides separated by other amino acid sequences. Another embodiment is ( 1C multiple antigen peptides ( MAPs ) . MAPs haVe a small immunologically inert c0re haVing radially branching lysine dendrites , ont0 Which a number of otC polypeptides are c0Valently attached. See for instance , Posnett et al. ( 1988 ) J. Bi0l. Chem. 263 : 1719i1725 ; and Tam ( l989 ) Meth. Enz. 168 : 7—l5. The result is a large macromolecule haVing a high molar rati0 0f 0LC p0lypeptides to core. MAPs are eﬁicient immunogens and useﬁil antigens f0r immun0assays. The core for creating an o. C MAP can be made by standard peptide synthesis techniques , or obtained commercially , e. g. , from Quality Controlled Biochemicals , Inc. , Hopkinton , Mass. A typical core matrix is made up 0f three leVels of lysine and eight amino acids. When using ( 1C polypeptides as immunogens , preferably the polypeptides are deliVered in conjunction With a carrier. Any carrier can be used Which is not harmful to the host. Suitable carriers are typically large , slole metabolized macromolecules such as pr0teins ; polysaccharides ( such as latex functionalized Sepharose , agarose , cellulose , cellulose beads and the like ) ; polymeric amino acids ( such as polyglutamic acid , polylysine , and the like ) ; amino acid copolymers ; and inactiVe Virus particles or attenuated bacteria , such as Salm0nella. Especially useﬁil carrier proteins are serum albumins , keyhole limpet hemacyanin ( KLH ) , certain Ig molecules , thyroglobulin , oValbumin , and tetanus toxoid. KLH is especially preferred. dC p0lypeptides of the inVention can be identiﬁed in a number of Ways. For example , the V regions of the L and H chains can be screened by preparing a series of short polypeptides that together span the entire V region amino acid sequence. Using a series of polypeptides of 20 or 50 amino acids in length , each dC V regi0n can be surVeyed for useful functional properties. It is also possible to carry out a computer analysis of a protein sequence to identify potentially interesting polypeptides , such as those that bear the shape of D2 , or those inVolVed in idi0type - anti - idiotype contact. The inVention further encompasses Various adaptations of ( 1C described in this section combined in Various fashions to yield 0ther ( 1C p0lypeptides With desirable properties. For instance , ( 1C polypeptides With modiﬁed amino acid residues can be comprised in a MAP. In another example , a ( 1C scFV is fused to a cytokine , such as IL - 2. All such combinations are contemplated in this inVention. The polypeptides of this inVention can be made by any suitable procedure , including proteolysis of the OtC antibody , by recombinant meth0ds 0r by chemical synthesis. These methods are knoWn in the art and need not be described in detail herein. Examples of proteolytic enzymes include , but are not limited to , trypsin , chymotrypsin , pepsin , papain , V8 protease , subtilisin , plasmin , and thr0mbin. Intact o. C can be incubated With one or more pr0teinases simultaneously or sequentially. AlternatiVely , or in addition , intact antibody can be treated With disulﬁde reducing agents. Peptides can then be separated from each other by techniques knoWn in the art including , but not limited to , gel ﬁltrati0n chromatography , gel electrophoresis , and reVerse - phase HPLC. ( 1C polypeptides can also be made by expression fr0m a polynucleotide encoding the peptide according to the information proVided elseWhere in this application , in a suitable expression system. Typically , polynucleotides encoding a CC p0lypeptide are ligated int0 an expression Vect0r under. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 22. lysed cells or from the culture medium and puriﬁed to the extent needed for its intended use. Examples of prokaryotic host cells appropriate for use With this inVention include E. c0li. Examples of eukaryotic host cells include aVian , insect , plant , and animal cells including , but not limited to , COS7 , HeLa , and CHO cells. In certain applications , such as When a H1l polypeptide is expressed in a suitable storage medium such as a plant seed , the H11 polypeptide can be used Without puriﬁcation. Fiedler et al. ( 1995 ) Bi0techn0l0gy 13 : 1090—1093. For most applications , it is generally preferable that the polypeptide is at least partially puriﬁed from other cellular constituents. Preferably , the polypeptide is at least about 50% pure as a Weight percent of total protein. More preferably , the protein is at least ab0ut 50—75% pure. For clinical use , the p0lypeptide is preferably at least about 80% pure. The inVention also encompasses methods of detecting C antigen in a biological sample. The methods include obtaining a bi0logical sample , contacting the sample With ( 1C under conditi0ns that all0W antib0dy antigen binding and detecting binding , if any , of the antibody to the antigen. The inVention also encompasses methods of detecting anti - Hll or anti - ( 1C in a biological sample. Anti - ( 1C is detectable WheneVer it cross - reacts With Hl l. Anti - dC With this actiVity can sp0ntaneously arise during the course of a tumor - associated disease. Anti - otC With this actiVity is especially likely in indiViduals Who haVe receiVed a course of therapy With 0. C. These methods are applicable in a clinical setting , for example , for monitoring antibody leVels in an indiVidual , as Well as an industrial setting , as in commercial production of anti - Hl1 or anti - o : C. The assay methods entail contacting any anti - Hl1 or anti - 01C target antibody in the sample With a H1l antibody or polypeptide under conditi0ns suitable to all0W the formation of a stable complex betWeen the target and H11 , and detecting any stable complex formed. The sample is suitably prepared before conducting the assay , optionally by enriching for antibody concentration. When using intact murine o. C , it is generally preferable t0 deplete the sample of any anti - mouse immunoglobulin actiVity that may be present. Anti - mouse immunoglobulin antibody can be remoVed from a sample , for example , by precipitation With normal mouse IgG or adsorption With a mouse Ig adsorbent. Binding of anti - mouse immunoglobulin antibody , particularly that spe - ciﬁc for the Fc region , can be minimized by judicious choice of the reagents of the assay. F ( ab‘ ) 2 or Fab fragments of murine otC and other reagents such as humanized otC or Hl1 , With feWer m0use determinants are appr0priate. After the sample is suitably prepared , it is mixed With a excess ( 1C under conditions that permit formation of a complex betWeen o. C and any target antibody that may be present. The amount of complex is then determined , and compared With complexes formed With standard samples containing knoWn am0unts of target antibody in the range expected. Complex formation can be obserVed by any method knoWn in the art such as immunoprecipitation or nephelometry , but it is generally more sensitiVe to employ a reagent labeled With such labels as radiois0topes such as lz5I , enzymes such as peroxidase and B - galactosidase , or ﬁuorochromes such as ﬁuorescein. The inVention proVides Various polynucleotides encoding the antibody H1l or fragments of H1l , based on the polynucleotide sequences proVided herein ( SEQ ID NOS : 1 and 4 ) . Various embodiments are described in this section , . control of a suitable promoter and used to genetically alter 65 comprising a number of diﬁerent combinations of the H11 H. the intended host cell. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic host systems can be used. The polypeptide is then isolated from. or L chain V region sequences. In general , a H1l polynucleotide of this inVention encodes at least one feature that is. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 23. unique to the H11 molecule ( in comparison With other immunoglobulins and , in particular , the A6 antib0dy ) .

ID NO : 5. The inVention also includes isolated H1l polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide haVing immun0logic actiVity 0f H1l , Wherein the polynucleotide encodes at least 5 amino acids of a V H chain of Hl1 as depicted in SEQ.

ID NO : l or SEQ ID NO : 4 With changes designed t0 optimize codon usage , stability , facilitate cloning , or any other purpose. It is Within the skill of one in the art , giVen the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO : 2 or SEQ ID NO : 5 , to design such polynucleotides. Preferred polynucleotides encode at least ﬁVe amino acids 0f a Hll CDR. The inVention also encompasses polynucleotides encoding for ﬁincti0nally equiValent Variants and deriVatiVes of H11 and ﬁinctionally equiValent fragments thereof Which may enhance , decrease or not signiﬁcantly aﬁect properties of the polypeptides encoded thereby. These functionally equiValent Variants , deriVatiVes , and fragments display the ability to speciﬁcally recognize C antigen. For instance , changes in a DNA sequence that do not change the encoded amino acid sequence , as Well as those that result in conserVatiVe substitutions of amino acid residues , one or a feW amino acid deletions or additions , and substitution of amino acid residues by amino acid anal0gs are those Which Will n0t. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 24. acid / glutamic acid ; serine / threonine / methi0nine ; lysine / arginine ; and phenylalanine / tyrosine / tryptophan. The polynucleotides of the inVention may comprise additional sequences , such as additional encoding sequences Within the same transcription unit , controlling elements such as promoters , ribosome binding sites , and polyadenylation sites , additional transcription units under control of the same or a diﬁ°erent prom0ter , sequences that permit cloning , expressi0n , and transf0rmation of a host cell , and any such construct as may be desirable to proVide embodiments of this inVention. The inVention encompasses a polynucleotide of at least about lS consecutiVe nucleotides , preferably at least about 20 nucleotides , more preferably at least about 25 consecutiVe nucle0tides , more preferably at least about 35 c0nsecutiVe nucle0tides , more preferably at least about 50 c0nsecutiVe nucleotides , eVen more preferably at least about 75 nucleotides , still more preferably at least about lO0 nucleotides , still more preferably at least about 200 nucleotides , and eVen more preferably at least about 300 nucleotides that forms a stable hybrid With a polynucleotide encoding the L chain or H chain V region of H1l , but not With other immunoglobulin encoding regions knoWn at the time of ﬁling of this application. Any set of conditions may be used for this test , as long as at least 0ne set of conditions exist Wherein the test polynucleotide demonstrates the required speciﬁcity. Preferably , the H1l encoding sequences to Which the test polynucleotide binds are those shoWn in SEQ. ID NOS : l and 4. Since the knoWn immunoglobulin sequences fall into a hierarchy of similarity With that of Hll , the test may be performed by c0mparing the hybridization of the test polynucleotide With the Hl1 sequence With the hybridization With the most closely related sequences. Preferred is a panel of about lO of the most cl0sely related sequences to SEQ. ID NO : l , 3 , 4 or 5. Hybridization reactions can be performed under conditions of different “stringency”. Conditions that increase stringency of a hybridization reaction are Well knoWn. See , for example , Sambrook and Maniatis. Examples of releVant conditions include ( in order of increasing stringency ) : incubation temperatures of 25° C. , 37° C. , 50° C. and 68° C. ; buffer concentrations of leSSC , 6><SSC , leSC , 0. l><SSC ( Where SSC is 0. l5M NaCl and lS mM citrate buﬁer ) and their equiValent using other buﬁer systems ; formamide concentrations of 0% , 25% , 50% , and 75% ; incubation times from 5 minutes to 24 hours ; 1 , 2 , or more Washing steps ; Wash incubation times of l , 2 , 0r lS minutes ; and Wash solutions of 6><SSC , l><SSC , 0. l><SSC , or deionized Water. Useful H11 polynucleotides encoding fragments of H1l may be identiﬁed by generating polynucleotide fragments ( based 0n SEQ ID NO : 1 0r SEQ ID NO : 4 , for example ) and testing the polypeptides encoded thereby for a ﬁinction of interest. AltematiVely , the polypeptide fragment - encoded by a particular polynucleotide can be prepared and tested for a function of interest. AltematiVely , giVen a OtC polypeptide With desirable properties , polynucleotides can be designed that encode the p0lypeptide. Included in all these embodiments are polynucleotides With encoding regions for H1l polymers , fusion proteins , humanized immunoglobulins , single - chain V regions , and other particular polypeptides 0f interest. These polypeptides are described aboVe. The inVenti0n also pr0Vides polynucleotides coValently. signiﬁcantly aﬁect properties of the encoded polypeptide. 65 linked With a detectable label. Such polynucleotides are. ConserVatiVe amino acid substitutions are glycine / alanine ; Valine / isoleucine / leucine ; asparagine / glutamine ; aspartic. useful , for example , as probes for detection of related nucleotide sequences. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 25. The polynucleotides of this inVention can be obtained using chemical synthesis , recombinant cloning methods , PCR , or any combination thereof. Methods of chemical polynucleotide synthesis are Well knoWn in the art and need not be described in detail herein. One of skill in the art can use the sequence data proVided herein to obtain a desired polynucleotide by employing a DNA synthesizer or ordering from a commercial serVice. AltematiVely , ( 1C polynucleotide sequences can be obtained fr0m a CC antib0dy producing cell line , ( 1C cl0ning Vector , or ( 1C expression Vector. RNA or DNA encoding the desired sequence can be isolated , ampliﬁed , and processed by standard recombinant techniques. Such techniques include digestion With restriction nucleases , and ampliﬁcation by p0lymerase chain reacti0n ( PCR ) , or a suitable combination thereof. PCR technology is described in U. S. Pat. Nos. 4 , 683 , l95 , 4 , 800 , 159 , 4 , 754 , 065 and 4 , 683 , 202 , as Well as PCR : The P0lymerase Chain Reacti0n , Mullis et al. eds. , BirkausWer Press , Bost0n ( l994 ) . P0lynucle0tides c0mprising a desired sequence can be inserted into a suitable Vector , and the Vector in turn can be introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and ampliﬁcation. Polynucleotides can be introduced into host cells by any means knoWn in the art. Cells are transformed by introducing an exogenous polynucleotide by direct uptake , endocytosis , transfection , f - mating or electroporation. Once introduced , the exogenous polynucleotide can be maintained Within the cell as a non - integrated Vector ( such as a plasmid ) or integrated into the h0st cell genome. Ampliﬁed DNA can be isolated from the host cell by standard methods. See , e. g. , Sambrook et al. ( l989 ) . RNA can also be obtained from transformed host cell , or it can be obtained directly from the DNA by using a DNA - dependent RNA polymerase. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. The present inVention further encompasses a Variety of 35. Vectors comprising a HH polynucleotide. These Vectors can be used for expression of recombinant polypeptides are also a source of H1l polynucleotides. Cloning Vectors can be used to obtain replicate copies 0f the Hll polynucleotides they contain , or as a means of storing the polynucleotides in a depository for future recoVery. Expression Vectors ( and host cells containing these expression Vect0rs ) can be used to obtain polypeptides produced from the polynucleotides they contain. They can also be used Where it is desirable to express H11 in an indiVidual and thus haVe intact cells capable of synthesizing the polypeptide , such as in gene therapy. Suitable cloning and expression Vectors include any knoWn in the art , e. g. , th0se for use in bacterial , mammalian , yeast and insect expression systems. Speciﬁc Vectors and suitable host cells are knoWn in the art and are not described in detail herein. See e. g. Gacesa and Ramji , Vectors , John Wiley & Sons ( l994 ) . Cloning and expression Vect0rs typically contain a selectable marker ( for example , a gene enc0ding a pr0tein necessary for the surViVal or grthh of a host cell transformed With the Vector ) , although such a marker gene can be carried on another polynucleotide sequence co - introduced into the host cell. Only those host cells int0 Which a selectable gene has been intr0duced Will gr0W under selectiVe conditions. Typical selection genes either : ( a ) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins , e. g. , ampicillin , neomycin , methotrexate ; ( b ) complement auxotrophic deﬁciencies ; or ( c ) supply critical nutrients not aVailable fr0m complex media. The choice 0f the proper marker gene Will depend on the h0st. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 26. Suitable cloning Vectors can be constructed according to standard techniques , or selected from a large number of cloning Vectors aVailable in the art. While the cloning Vector selected may Vary acc0rding to the h0st cell intended t0 be used , useful cloning Vect0rs Will generally haVe the ability to self - replicate , may possess a single target for a particular rest1iction endonuclease , or may carry marker genes. Suitable examples include plasmids and bacterial Viruses , e. g. , pUC18 , mp18 , mp19 , pBR322 , pMB9 , C0lE1 , pCR1 , RP4 , phage DNAs , and shuttle Vect0rs such as pSA3 and pAT28. These and other cloning Vectors are aVailable from c0m - mercial Vendors such as BioRad , Stratagene , and InVitrogen. Expression Vectors generally are replicable polynucleotide constructs that contain a p0lynucle0tide encoding a ( 1C polypeptide of interest. The polynucleotide enc0ding ( 1C polypeptide is operatiVely linked to suitable transcriptional controlling elements , such as promoters , enhancers and tenninators. For expression ( i. e. , translation ) , one or more translati0nal controlling elements are also usually required , such as ribos0me binding sites , translation initiation sites , and stop codons. These controlling elements ( transcriptional and translational ) can be deriVed from the Hl1 gene , or heterologous ( i. e. , deriVed from other genes or other organisms ) . A polynucleotide sequence enc0ding a signal peptide can also be included to all0W a OtC polypeptide to cross or lodge in cell membranes or be secreted from the cell. A number of expression Vectors suitable for expression in eukaryotic cells including yeast , aVian , and mammalian cells are knoWn in the art. One example 0f an expression Vector is pcDNA3 ( InVitrogen , San Diego , Calif. ) , in Which transcription is driVen by the cytomegaloVirus ( CMV ) early promoter / enhancer. This Vector also contains recognition sites for multiple restriction enzymes for insertion of an ( 1C polynucleotide of interest. Another example 0f an expression Vector ( system ) is the baculoVirus / insect system. Also encompassed by the inVention are expression systems suitable for use in antibody - targeted gene therapy comprising a CC polynucleotide. Suitable systems are described for instance by BroWn et al. ( l994 ) Vir0l. l98 : 477—488 ; and Miyamura et al. ( 1994 ) Pr0c. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 91 : 8507—8511. The Vectors containing the polynucle0tides 0f interest can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means , including electroporation , transfection employing calcium chloride , rubidium chloride , calcium phosphate , DEAE - dextran , or other substances ; microprojectile bombardment ; lipofection ; and infection ( Where the Vect0r is an infectious agent , such as Vaccinia Virus , Which is discussed beloW ) . The choice of intr0ducing Vectors or ( 1C polynucleotides Will often depend on features of the host cell. Once introduced into a suitable host cell , expression of a CC polypeptide can be determined using any assay knoWn in the art. For example , presence 0f ( 1C polypeptide can be detected by RIA or ELISA of the culture supernatant ( if the H11 polypeptide is secreted ) or cell lysates. A particularly useful expression Vector for Hl1 polynucle0tides is a Vaccinia Virus comprised of a Hll p0lynucle0tide sequence , Which can also be used in Vaccine preparations. Moss ( 1991 ) Science 252 : 1662—1667. To introduce polynucleotide sequences encoding H1l polypeptide , including H1l polypeptide fragments , into Vaccinia , the polynucleotide sequence of interest is ﬁrst inserted into a plasmid containing a Vaccinia Virus pr0moter With ﬁanking. cell , and appropriate genes for diﬁ"erent hosts are knoWn in 65 sequences homologous to Vaccinia DNA not required for. the art. Vectors also typically contain a replication system recognized by the host. replication. Plasmid - containing cells are then infected With Vaccinia , Which leads to a loW leVel of homologous recom - . US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 27. bination betWeen plasmid and Virus , With resultant transfer of the Vaccinia promoter and H11 polypeptide - encoding polynucleotide sequence into the Vaccinia Virus genome. Typically , the H1l polynucleotide is inserted into the Viral TK ( thymidine kinase ) gene. Insertion into the TK site attenuates the Virus more than 10 , 000 fold compared to Wild type. Flexner et al. ( 1980 ) Vaccine 88 ( Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ) , pp. 179—184. Recombinant Virus is identiﬁed by the TK ' phenotype. Preferably , expression of the H11 polynucleotide is under the control of the Vaccinia early / late prom0ter ( 7.5 K ) , Whereby the resultant H 11 polypeptides can be expressed in infected cells throughout the life cycle of the Virus. HoWeVer , other promoters knoWn in the art can be used , such as pH6 , or synthetic prom0ters. Expressi0n of the H11 p0lypeptide occurs in cells infected With the rec0m - binant Vaccinia or indiViduals immunized With the liVe recombinant Vaccinia Virus. Any one of seVeral strains of Vaccinia can be used , including , but not limited to , WR , ALVAC , and NYVAC. A Vector of this inVention can contain one or m0re polynucleotides encoding a ( 1C polypeptide. It can also contain polynucleotide sequences encoding other polypeptides that enhance , facilitate , or modulate the desired result , such as lymphokines , including , but not limited to , IL - 2 , IL4 , GM - CSF , TNF - o1 , and IFN - V. A preferred lymphokine is GM - CSF. Preferred GM - CSF constructs are those Which haVe been deleted for the AU - rich elements from the 3 ' untranslated regions and sequences in the 5 ' untranslated regi0n that are capable of f0rming a hairpin loop. Also embodied in this inVention are Vaccinia Vectors encoding for recombinant otC Variants , such as scFVs , chimeras , and polymers. Other embodiments 0f this inVention are h0st cells transformed With dC polynucleotides and Vectors comprising ( 1C polynucleotide sequences , as described aboVe. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells may be used. Prokaryotic hosts include bacterial cells , for example E. c0li and Myc0bacteria. Among eukaryotic hosts are yeast , insect , aVian , plant and mammalian cells. Host systems are knoWn in the art and need not be described in detail herein. Examples of mammalian host cells include CHO and NSO , obtainable from the European Collection 0f Cell Cultures ( England ) . Transfection of NSO cells With a plasmid , for example , Which is driVen by a CMV promoter , folloWed by ampliﬁcation of this plasmid in using glutamine synthetase proVides a useful system for protein production. Cockett et al. ( l990 ) Bi0 / Techn0l0gy 8 : 662—667. The host cells of this inVention can be used , inter alia , as reposit0ries of ( 1C polynucle0tides , or as Vehicles for production of ( 1C polynucleotides and polypeptides. They may also be used as Vehicles for in ViVo expression of ( 1C polypeptides. The Hl1 polynucleotides of this inVention can be used in expression systems t0 produce Hl1 p0lypeptides , intact H11 , or rec0mbinant f0rms 0f H11 , such as are described below. The polynucleotides of this inVention haVe seVeral uses. They are useful , for example , in expression systems for the production of ( 1C. They are also useful as hybridization probes to assay for the presence 0f ( 1C p0lynucle0tide or related sequences in a sample using methods Well knoWn to those in the art. Further , the polynucleotides are also useful as primers to e1fect ampliﬁcation of desired polynucleotides. The polynucleotides of this inVention are also useﬁil in pharmaceutical c0mp0sitions including Vaccines and for gene therapy. The polynucleotides can also be used as hybridization probes for detection of 0C encoding sequences. Suitable. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 28. samples include cells transformed ex ViVo for use in gene therapy. In one illustration , DNA or RNA is extracted from a sample , and optionally run on a gel and / or digested With restriction endonucleases. The pr0cessed sample polynucleotide is typically transferred to a medium suitable for Washing. The sample polynucleotide is then contacted With the H11 polynucleotide probe under conditions that permit a stable duplex to form if the sample contains a matching ( 1C sequence. Any stable duplexes f0rmed are detected by any suitable means. For example , the ( 1C p0lynucleotide probe can be supplied in labeled f0rm , and label remaining With the sample after Washing Will directly reﬁect the amount of stable duplex formed. In a second illustration , hyb1idization is perf0rmed in situ. A suitably prepared tissue sample is oVerlaid With a labeled probe to indicate the locati0n ( 1C encoding sequences. A short ( 1C polynucleotide can also be used as a primer for a PCR reaction , particularly to amplify a longer sequence comprising a region hybridizing With the primer. This can be conducted preparatiVely , in order to produce polynucleotide for ﬁirther genetic manipulati0n. It can als0 be c0nducted analytically , to determine Whether a CC encoding polynucleotide is present , for example , in a sample of diagnostic interest. Another use of the polynucleotides is in Vaccines and gene therapy. The general principle is to administer the polynucleotide so that it either promotes or attenuates the expression of the polypeptide encoded therein. Thus , the present inVention includes methods of inducing an immune response and methods of treatment comprising administration of an eﬁectiVe amount ( 1C polynucleotides to an indiVidual. In these methods , a ( 1C polynucleotide encoding a ( 1C polypeptide is administered to an indiVidual , either directly or Via cells transfected With the ( 1C polynucleotide. Preferably , the 0C polynucleotide is in the form of a circular plasmid , preferably in a supercoiled conﬁguration. Preferably , the o. C polynucleotide is replicated inside a cell. Thus , the ( 1C polynucleotide is operatiVely linked to a suitable prom0ter , such as a heter0logous promoter that is intrinsically actiVe in cells of the target tissue type. Preferably , once in cell nuclei , plasmids persist as circular non - replicating episomal molecules. In Vitro mutation can be carried out With plasmid constructs to encode , for example , molecules With greater aﬁinity and / or aVidity. To determine Whether plasmids containing ( 1C polynucleotides are capable of 0C expression in eukaryotic cells , cells such as COS - 7 , CHO , or HeLa can be transfected With the plasmids. Expression of ( 1C is then determined by immunoassay ; for example , by Western blot. Smaller otC polypeptides can be detected , for example , by constructing the plasmid so that the resultant 0. C polypeptide is ﬁJsed With a tag , such as a target epitope or enzyme label. Further characterization of the expressed ( 1C polypeptide can be achieVed by purifying the peptide and then conducting one of the functional assays described herein. In one mode 0f gene therapy , the polynucleotides of this inVenti0n are used f0r genetically altering cells ex ViVo. In this strategy , cells remoVed from a donor 0r obtained from a cell line are transfected or transduced With Vectors encoding a otC polypeptide , and then administered to a recipient. Suitable cells for transfection include peripheral blo0d m0nonuclear cells. In an0ther mode 0f gene therapy , the p0lynucle0tides of this inVention are used for genetically altering cells in ViVo. The purpose includes , but is not limited to , treating Various types of cancer. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 29. ( 1C polypeptides can be characterized in seVeral Ways. For instance , a ( 1C polypeptide may be tested for its ability to bind speciﬁcally to cancer cells , for its ability to speciﬁcally inhibit the binding betWeen cancer cells and intact Hll. A dC polypeptide can also react With anti - CDR3 p0lypeptides. o. C polypeptides can also be tested for their ability to palliate or ameliorate neoplastic disease , such as carcinomas. It is understood that only one of these properties need be present in order for a polypeptide to come Within the scope 0f this inVention , alth0ugh preferably m0re than one of these pr0p - erties is present. The ability of a ( 1C polypeptide to bind cancer cells or antigenic fractions thereof can be tested by immunoassay. Any f0rm 0f direct binding assay is suitable. In one such assay , the cancer cell 0r the putatiVe ( 1C polypeptide is labeled. Suitable labels include radioisotopes such as 12°I , enzymes such as peroxidase , ﬁuorescent labels such as ﬁuorescein , and chemiluminescent labels. Typically , the other binding partner is insolubilized ( for example , by coating onto a microtiter plate ) to facilitate Washing. After combining the labeled component With the insolubilized component , the solid phase is Washed and the amount of bound label is determined. Another such assay is a sandWich assay , in Which the putatiVe ( 1C polypeptide is captured by a ﬁrst anti - immunoglobulin on a solid phase and deVeloped With ( 1C antibody. In either of these examples , the extent of binding of ( 1C is directly related to the amount of label bound to the solid phase. T0 c0nduct the inhibition assays , the putatiVe ( 1C polypeptide is titered for its ability to decrease the binding of Hl1 to cancer cells. Either of the binding pairs in the reaction to be inhibited is labeled , While the other is typically insolubilized in order to facilitate Washing. The putatiVe ( 1C polypeptide is typically mixed With the labeled component , and then the mixture is combined With the solid phase. Polypeptides With the characteristics of H11 Will proportionately decrease the amount of label attached to the solid phase , compared With control polypeptides. This test may be more sensitiVe than measuring direct binding , because loWer aﬁinity interaction betWeen CC and C antigen may be too Weak to form a stable bond , but adequate to interfere With the binding of another ligand - receptor pair When present at suﬁicient concentration. The present inVention enc0mpasses pharmaceutical compositions and immunogenic comp0sitions containing 0. C either alone or in combination. Such pharmaceutical compositions and Vaccines are useful for eliciting an immune resp0nse and treating neoplastic diseases , either alone 0r in conjunction With other f0rms of therapy , such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions that contain ( 1C antibody , or a polynucleotide or a polypeptide deriVatiVe thereof as an actiVe ingredient is 00nducted in accordance With generally accepted procedures f0r the preparation of pharmaceutical preparations. See , for example , Remingt0ns Pharmaceatical Sciences lSth Edi— ti0n ( 1990 ) , E. W. Martin ed. , Mack Publishing Co. , PA. Depending on the intended use and mode 0f administrati0n , it may be desirable to pr0cess the actiVe ingredient further in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. Appropriate processing may include ste1ilizing , mixing With appropriate non - toxic and non - interfering components , diViding into dose units , and enclosing in a deliVery deVice. Liquid phannaceutically acceptable compositions can , for example , be prepared by dissolVing or dispersing a polypeptide embodied herein in a liquid excipient , such as Water , saline , aqueous dextrose , glycerol , or ethanol. The compo - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 30. sition can also contain other medicinal agents , phannaceutical agents , adjuVants , car1iers , and auxiliary substances such as Wetting or emulsifying agents , and pH buffering agents. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present inVention are administered by a mode appropriate for the form of composition. Typical routes include subcutaneous , intramuscular , intraperit0neal , intradennal , oral , intranasal , and intrapulmonary ( i. e. , by aer0sol ) . Pharmaceutical comp0sitions of this inVention for human use are typically administered by a parenteral route , most typically intracutaneous , subcutaneous , 0r intramuscular. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral , intranasal , or topical administration can be supplied in solid , semi - solid or liquid forms , including tablets , capsules , poWders , liquids , and suspensi0ns. Compositions for injection can be supplied as liquid solutions or suspensions , as emulsions , or as solid forms suitable for dissolution or suspension in liquid prior to injection. For administration Via the respiratory tract , a preferred composition is one that proVides a solid , poWder , or liquid aerosol When used With an appropriate aerosolizer deVice. Although not required , pharmaceutical compositions are preferably supplied in unit dosage form suitable for administration of a precise amount. Also contemplated by this inVention are sloW release or sustained release forms , Whereby a relatiVely consistent leVel 0f the actiVe compound are proVided oVer an extended period. Compositions embodied in this inVention can be assessed for their ability to recognize speciﬁcally a neoplasia. Accordingly , test compounds are prepared as a suitable pharmaceutical composition and administered to test subjects. Initial studies are preferably done in small animals such as mice or rabbits , optionally next in non - human primates and then ultimately in humans. Immunogenicity is preferably tested in indiViduals Without a preVious antibody response. A test composition in an appropriate dose is administered 0n an appropriate treatment schedule. It may be appropriate to compare diﬁ°erent doses and schedules Within the predicted range. Such testing is Within the skill of one in the art. Compositions of this inVention are particularly suitable for administration to humans With a neoplastic disease. Especially releVant are melanoma , neuroblastoma , glioma , sarcoma , lymphoma , and small cell lung cancer. Also included in this inVention are methods for treating cancer. The methods c0mprise administering an amount of a pharmaceutical composition containing ( 1C effectiVe to achieVe the desired effect , be it palliation of an existing tumor mass or preVention of recurrence. For treatment of cancer , the amount of a pharmaceutical composition administered is an amount eﬁectiVe in producing the desired eﬁect. An eﬁ°ectiVe amount can be pr0Vided in one 0r a series of administrations. The eﬁectiVe amount of o. C antigen binding fragments to be administered Will depend upon seVeral factors , such as the route of administration , the condition of the indiVidual , and the desired objectiVe. The term “therapeutically effectiVe” means that the amount 0f antigen binding fragment used is of suﬁicient quantity to ameliorate the cancer. “Ameliorate” denotes a lessening of the detrimental eﬁect of the cancer on the indiVidual. Typically , if administered directly , the amount per administration is about 10 ng to 20 mg , preferably 250 pg to 10 mg , m0re preferably 300 pg to 5 mg , eVen more preferably 500 ng to 2.5 mg. Administrations are typically conducted on a Weekly or biWeekly basis until a desired , measurable parameter is detected , such as. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 31. diminution of disease symptoms. Administrati0n can then be continued on a less frequent basis , such as biWeekly or monthly , as appropriate. The Various compositi0ns of this inVention can be used al0ne , or in conjuncti0n With 01her actiVe agents that promote the desired objectiVe , or proVide a desirable adjunct therapy. Suitable actiVe agents include the anti - neoplastic drugs and bioresponse modiﬁers described aboVe and eﬁector cells such as those described by Douillard et al. ( 1986 ) Hybrid0mas ( Supp. l : 5l39 ) . When used for immunotherapy , ( 1C can be unlabeled or labeled With a therapeutic agent as described aboVe. These agents can be coupled either directly or indirectly to the polypeptides of the inVention. One example of indirect coupling is by use of a spacer moiety. These spacer m0ieties , in turn , can be either insoluble or soluble ( Diener et al. ( 1986 ) Science 23l : 148 ) and can be selected to enable drug release from CC at the target site. AlternatiVely , an CC and a therapeutic agent can be translated , synthesized , ligated or otherWise produced as a single molecule Which has both ( 1C and therapeutic agent functions. Examples of therapeutic agents Which can be coupled to ( 1C for immunotherapy include , but are not limited to , bioresponse modiﬁers , drugs , radi0isotopes , lectins , and toxins. Bioresponse modiﬁers include lymphokines Which include , but are not limited to , tumor necrosis factor , interleukins 1 , 2 , and 3 , lymphotoxin , macrophage actiVating factor , migration inhibition factor , colony stimulating factor , and interferon. Interferons With Which ( 1C can be labeled include d - interferon , B - interferon , and y - interferon ( IFN - V ) and their subtypes. In using radioisotopically conjugated o. C for immunotherapy , certain isotypes may be more preferable than others depending on such factors as leukocyte distribution as Well as isotype stability and emission. If desired , the malignant cell distribution can be eValuated by the in ViVo diagnostic techniques described below Depending on the malignancy , some emitters may be preferable to others. In general , alpha and beta particle - emitting radioisotopes are preferred in immunotherapy. For example , if an animal has solid tumor foci , as in a carcin0ma , a high energy beta emitter capable of penetrating seVeral millimeters of tissue , such as 90Y , may be preferable. On the other hand , if the malignancy consists of simple target cells , as in the case of leukemia , a short range , high energy alpha emitter , such as 212Bi , may be preferable. Radioisotopes Which can be bound to the antigen. binding fragments of the inVention for therapeutic purposes include , but are not limited to , 12°I , 131I , 9°Y , 67Cu , 212Bi , . 21lAt , 212Pb , 47SC , lO9Pd , and lS8Re. Lectins are pr0teins , usually isolated fr0m plant material , Which bind to speciﬁc sugar m0ieties. Many lectins are also able to agglutinate cells and stimulate lymphocytes. HoWeVer , ricin is a toxic lectin Which has been used immunotherapeutically. This is preferably accomplished by binding the alpha - peptide chain 0f ricin , Which is responsible for toxicity , to the antibody molecule to enable site speciﬁc deliVery of the toxic e1fect. Toxins are poisonous substances produced by plants , animals , or microorganisms that , in sufficient dose , are often lethal. Diphtheria t0xin is a substance pr0duced by C0rynebacteriam diphtheria Which can be used therapeutically. This toxin consists of an alpha and beta subunit Which under proper conditions can be separated. The toxic A chain component can be bound to an antibody and used for site - speciﬁc deliVery t0 a neoplastic cell. Thus , for example , ( 1C can be used in combination With alpha - interferon. This treatment modality enhances Mab targeting of melanomas by increasing the expression of Mab. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 32. reactiVe antigen by the melanoma cells. Greiner et al. ( 1987 ) Science 235 : 895. AltematiVely , o. C could be used , for example , in combination With IFN - y to thereby actiVate and increase the expressi0n of Fc receptors by effector cells Which , in turn , results in an enhanced binding of the antigen binding fragments to the eﬁ°ector cell and killing of target malignant cells. Those of skill in the art Will be able to select from the Various biological response modiﬁers to create a desired eﬁector ﬁinction Which enhances the eﬁicacy of ( 1C. When ( 1C is used in combinati0n With Various therapeutic agents , such as those described herein , the administration of both usually occurs substantially contemporaneously. The term “substantially contemporaneously” means that they are administered reasonably close together With respect to time. Usually , it is preferred to administer the therapeutic agent before ( 1C. For example , the therapeutic agent can be administered 1 to 6 days before 0. C. The administration of the therapeutic agent can be daily , or at any other suitable interVal , depending upon such factors , for example , as the nature 0f the malignancy , the c0ndition of the patient and half - life of the agent. Using ( 1C , it is possible to design combination therapies. It may be desirable to administer a therapeutic agent , or agents , prior to the administration of dC in c0mbination With eﬁ°ector cells and the same , or diﬁerent , therapeutic agent or agents. For example , patients can be treated by ﬁrst administering IFN - V and interleukin - 2 ( I1 - 2 ) daily for 3 to 5 days , and on day 5 administering ( 1C in combination With eﬁ°ector cells , IFN - V , and Il - 2. The present inVention also encompasses the use of liposomes With membrane bound ( 1C to speciﬁcally deliVer the lipo some to the area of the tumor or neoplastic cells expressing C antigen. These liposomes can be produced such that they contain , in addition to ( 1C , such immunotherapeutic agents as those described aboVe Which Would then be released at the site of malignancy. Wolﬁ et al. ( l984 ) Bi0chem. Bi0phys. Acta 802 : 259. Another such deliVery system described by BroWn et al. ( l994 ) Vir0l0gy l98 : 477—488 ; and Miyamura et al. ( l994 ) Pr0c. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 9l : 8507—8511 utilizes chimeric parVoVirus B19 capsids for presentation of the antigen binding fragments. Such chimeric systems are encompassed for use in the claimed methods. The dosage ranges for the administration of ( 1C are those large enough to produce the desired effect in Which the symptoms of the malignant disease are ameliorated Without causing undue side eﬁects such as unWanted cross - reactions , anaphylactic reactions , and the like. Generally , the dosage Will Vary With the patients age , conditi0n , sex and extent of the disease and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage can be adjusted by the indiVidual physician in the eVent of any complication. Dosage can Vary from about 0. l mg / kg to about 2000 mg / kg , preferably about 0. l mg / kg to ab0ut 500 mg / kg , in one or more dose administrations daily , for one or seVeral days. Generally , When o. C are administered conjugated With therapeutic agents , loWer dosages , comparable to those used for in ViVo immunodiagnostic imaging , can be used. Therapeutic c0mp0siti0ns 0f otC can be administered by injection or by gradual perfusion. The 0. C antigen binding fragments can be administered intraVenously , intraperitoneally , intramuscularly , subcutaneously , intracaVity , intrathecally 0r transdennally , alone or in combinati0n With eﬁector cells. Another method of administration is intralesionally , for instance by direct injection directly into the tumor. Intralesional administration of Va1ious forms of immunotherapy to. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 33. cancer patients does not cause the t0xicity seen With systemic administration of immunologic agents. Fletcher et al. ( 1987 ) Lymph0kine Res. 6 : 45 ; RabinoWich et al. ( l987 ) Cancer Res. 47 : l73 ; Rosenberg et al. ( l989 ) Science 233 : 1318 ; and Pizz et al. ( 1984 ) lnt. J. Cancer 34 : 359. ( 1C is particularly suitable for use in treating and imaging brain cancer. When the site of deliVery is the brain , the therapeutic agent must be capable of being deliVered to the brain. The blood - brain barrier limits the uptake of many therapeutic agents int0 the brain and spinal cord fr0m the general circulation. Molecules Which cross the blood - brain barrier use tWo main mechanisms : free di1fusion ; and facilitated transport. Because of the presence of the blood - brain barrier , attaining beneﬁcial concentrations of a giVen therapeutic agent in the CNS may require the use of speciﬁc drug deliVery strategies. DeliVery of therapeutic agents to the CNS can be achieVed by seVeral methods. One method relies on neurosurgical techniques. In the case of graVely ill patients , surgical interVention is Warranted despite its attendant risks. F0r instance , therapeutic agents can be deliVered by direct physical introduction into the CNS , such as intraVentricular , intralesional , or intrathecal injection. IntraVentricular injection can be facilitated by an intraVentricular catheter , for example , attached to a reserVoir , such as an Ommaya reserVoir. Methods of introduction are also proVided by rechargeable or biodegradable deVices. Another approach is the disruption of the blood - brain barrier by substances Which increase the permeability of the bloodbrain barrier. Examples include intra - arterial infusion of poorly diﬁusible agents such as mannitol , pharmaceuticals Which increase cerebroVascular permeability such as etoposide , or VasoactiVe agents such as leukotrienes. NeuWelt and Rapp0port ( 1984 ) Fed. Pr0c. 43 : 2l4—2l9 ; Baba et al. ( l 991 ) J. Cereb. Bl00d Fl0w Metab. ll : 638—643 ; and Gennuso et al. ( l993 ) Cancer lnvest. ll : 638—643. Further , it may be desirable to administer the compositions locally to the area in need of treatment ; this can be achieVed by , for example , local infusion during surgery , by injection , by means of a catheter , or by means of an implant , said implant being of a porous , non - porous , or gelatinous material , including membranes , such as silastic membranes , or ﬁbers. A suitable such membrane is Gliadel® proVided by Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc. Another method inVolVes pharmacological techniques such as modiﬁcation or selection of the oiC to proVide an analog Which Will cross the blood - brain barrier. Examples include increasing the hydrophobicity of the molecule , decreasing net charge or molecular Weight 0f the molecule , or modifying the molecule , such as to resemble one n0r - mally transported across the blood - brain barrier. LeVin ( 1980 ) J. Med. Chem. 23 : 682—684 ; Pardridge ( l991 ) in : Peptide Drug Delivery t0 the Brain ; and Kostis et al. ( l994 ) J. Clin. Pharmac0l. 34 : 989—996. Encapsulati0n of oiC in a hydr0phobic enVironment such as lip0somes is also eﬁectiVe in deliVering drugs to the CNS. For example , WO 9l / 04014 describes a liposomal deliVery system in Which the drug is encapsulated Within liposomes to Which m0lecules haVe been added that are n0rmally transported acr0ss the bl00d - brain barrier. Another method of formulating CC to pass through the blood - brain banier is encapsulation in cyclodextrin. Any suitable cyclodextrin Which passes through the blood - brain barrier can be empl0yed , including , but n0t limited to , B - cycl0dextrin , y - cyclodextrin and deriVatiVes there0f See. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 34. Yet another method takes adVantage of physiological techniques such as conjugation of CC to a transportable agent to yield a neW chimeric transportable ( 1C. For example , VasoactiVe intestinal peptide analog ( VIPa ) exerts its VasoactiVe eﬁ°ects only after c0njugati0n to a Mab to the speciﬁc carrier molecule transferrin receptor , Which facilitates the uptake of the VIPa - Mab conjugate through the blood - brain barrier. Pard1idge ( 199l ) ; and Bickel et al. ( 1993 ) Pr0c. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 : 2618—2622. SeVeral other speciﬁc transport systems haVe been identiﬁed , these include , but are not limited to , those for transferring insulin , or insulin - like grthh factors I and II. Other suitable , non - speciﬁc carriers include , but are not limited to , py1i - dinium , fatty acids , inositol , ch0lesterol , and glucose deriVatiVes. Certain prodrugs haVe been described Whereby , up0n entering the central nerVous system , the drug is cleaVed from the carrier to release the actiVe drug. U. S. Pat. No. 5 , 0l7 , 566. Suitable subjects include those Who are suspected of being at risk of a path0logical effect of any neoplasia , particularly carcinoma , are suitable for treatment With the pharmaceutical compositions of this inVention. Those With a history of cancer are especially suitable. Suitable human subjects for therapy comprise tWo gr0ups , Which can be distinguished by clinical criteria. Patients With “adVanced disease” or “high turnor burden” are those Who bear a clinically measurable tumor. A clinically measurable tumor is one that can be detected on the basis of tumor mass ( e. g. , by palpation , CAT scan , or X - Ray ; positiVe bi0chemical or histopathological markers on their oWn may be insuﬁicient to identify this population ) . A pharmaceutical composition embodied in this inVention is administered to these patients to elicit an anti - tumor response , With the objectiVe of palliating their condition. Ideally , reduction in tumor mass occurs as a result , but any clinical improVement constitutes a beneﬁt. Clinical improVement includes decreased risk or rate of progression or reduction in pathological consequences of the tumor. A second group of suitable subjects is knoWn in the art as the “adjuVant group”. These are indiViduals Wh0 haVe had a history of cancer , but haVe been responsiVe to another mode of therapy. The prior therapy may haVe included , but is not restricted to , surgical resection , radiotherapy , and traditional chemotherapy. As a result , these indiViduals haVe no clinically measurable tumor. HoWeVer , they are suspected of being at risk for progression of the disease , either near the original tumor site , or by metastases. This group can be further subdiVided into high - risk and loW - risk indiViduals. The subdiVisi0n is made on the basis of features obserVed before or after the initial treatment. These features are knoWn in the clinical arts , and are suitably deﬁned for each diiferent cancer. Features typical of high risk subgroups are those in Which the tumor has inVaded neighb0ring tissues , or Wh0 shoW inVolVement 0f lymph nodes. Another suitable group of subjects is those With a genetic predisposition to cancer but Who haVe not yet eVidenced clinical signs of cancer. For instance , Women testing p0sitiVe for a genetic mutati0n associated With breast cancer , but still of childbearing age , may Wish to receiVe o. C treatment prophylactically to preVent the occurrence of cancer until it is suitable to perform preVentiVe surgery. A pharmaceutical composition embodied in this inVention is administered to patients in the adjuVant group , 0r in either. generally , U. S. Pat. Nos. 5 , 017 , 566 , 5 , 002 , 935 and 4 , 983 , 65 of these subgroups , in order to elicit an anti - cancer response. 586. Such compositions can also include a glycerol de1iVatiVe as desc1ibed by U. S. Pat. No. 5 , 153 , 179. Ideally , the composition delays recurrence of the cancer , or eVen better , reduces the risk of recurrence ( i. e. , improVes the. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 35. cure rate ) . Such parameters may be determined in comparison With other patient populations and other modes of therapy. Of c0urse , crossoVers betWeen these tWo patient groups occur , and the pharmaceutical c0mpositi0ns of this inVention can be administered at any time that is appropriate. For example , otC therapy can be conducted before or during traditional therapy of a patient With high tumor burden , and continued after the tumor becomes clinically undetectable. dC therapy can be continued in a patient Wh0 initially fell in the adjuVant group , but is shoWing signs of recurrence. The attending physician has the discretion to determine hoW or When the compositions of this inVention are to be used. Various compounds and comp0sitions of this inVention haVe 01her clinical indications , of Which the foll0Wing section proVides only a surVey. One indication is the treatment of cells ex ViVo. This may be desirable for expe1imental purposes , or for treatment of an indiVidual With a neoplastic disease. In one example , ( 1C is administered to a culture of cells , such as peripheral blood cells obtained from a donor , or a suitable cell line. About 0.5 to 2 ug / mL of H1l is an e1fectiVe dose for this purpose. In a second example , donor cells are genetically altered With an expression Vector of this inVention , t0 proVide for ongoing secreti0n of CC after administration of the cells to the recipient. The present inVention further encompasses methods for in ViVo detection of cancer cells. A diagn0stically effectiVe amount of detectably labeled ( 1C is giVen to the subject in need of tumor imaging. The term “diagnostically e1fectiVe” means that the amount of detectably labeled ( 1C is administered in suﬁicient quantity to enable detection of the neoplasia. The concentration of detectably labeled ( 1C Which is administered should be sufﬁcient such that the binding to those cells haVing C antigen is detectable compared to the background. Further , it is desirable that the detectably labeled ( 1C be rapidly cleared from the circulatory system in order to giVe the best target - to - background signal ratio. As a rule , the dosage of detectably labeled CC for in ViVo diagnosis is someWhat patient - speciﬁc and depends on such factors as age , sex , and extent of disease. The dosage of ( 1C can Vary from about 0.0l mg / m2 to about 500 mg / m2 , preferably 0. l mg / m2 to about 200 mg / m2 , most preferably about 0.1 mg / m2 to about 10 mg / m2. Such dosages may Vary , for example , depending on number of injections giVen , tumor burden , and other factors knoWn to those of skill in the art. For instance , tumors haVe been labeled in ViVo using cyanine - conjugated Mabs. Ballou et al. ( 1995 ) Cancer lmmun0l. lmman0ther. 4l : 257—263. For in ViVo diagnostic imaging , the type of detection instrument aVailable is a major factor in selecting a giVen radiois0tope. The radioisotope ch0sen must haVe a type of decay Which is detectable f0r a giVen type of instrument. Still another important factor in selecting a radiois0tope for in ViVo diagnosis is that the half - life of the radioisotope be long enough so that it is still detectable at the time of maximum uptake by the target , but short enough so that deleteri0us radiation With respect to the indiVidual is minimized. Ideally , a radioisotope used for in ViVo imaging lacks a particle emission , but produces a large number of photons in the 140—250 keV range , to be readily detected by conVentional gamma cameras. For imaging , doses 0f lllIn - H11 - scFV ( f0r instance , 2 mg of scFV labeled With 5 mCi of. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 36. For in ViVo diagnosis , radioisotopes can be bound to o. C either directly or indirectly by using an intermediate functional group. Intermediate functional groups Which are often used to bind metallic ion radioisotopes to immun0globulins are the bifuncti0nal chelating agents such as diethylene triaminepentacetic acid ( DTPA ) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) and similar molecules. Typical examples of metallic ions Which can be bound to ( 1C are 1111113 97Ru , °7Ga , °°Ga , 72AS , 892I ' , 90Y , and 20lT1. 0. C can also be labeled With a paramagnetic is0tope for purposes of in ViVo diagnosis , as in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) or electron spin resonance ( ESR ) . In general , any conVentional method for Visualizing diagnostic imaging can be utilized. Usually , gamma and positr0n emitting radiois0topes are used f0r camera imaging and paramagnetic isotopes for MRI. Elements Which are particularly useful in such techniques include 15 7Gd , 5 5Mn , 162DY , 52Cr , and 56Fe. o. C can also be labeled With a ﬁuorescent dye for the purpose of in ViVo diagnosis. dC can also be used to detect neoplasias using in Vitro assays. Samples are taken from the patient and subject to any suitable immunoassay With ( 1C to detect the presence of C antigen. This is particularly useful in detecting lymphomas and leukemias Where the tum0r cells bearing C antigen are circulating in the patients blo0dstream. ( 1C can also be used to monitor the course of amelioration of malignancy in an indiVidual. Thus , by measuring the increase or decrease in the number of cells expressing C antigen or changes in the c0ncentration of C antigen present in Various body ﬁuids , it is possible to determine Whether a particular therapeutic regimen aimed at ameliorating the malignancy is effectiVe. The present inVention encompasses kits containing ( 1C. Diagnostic procedures using ( 1C can be performed by diagnostic laborat0ries , experimental laboratories , practitioners , or priVate indiViduals. The clinical sample is optionally pre - treated for enrichment of the target being tested for. The user then applies a reagent contained in the kit in order to detect the changed leVel or alteration in the diagnostic component. Each kit comprises o. C used for detecting C antigen in the sample. Optionally , the reagent may be conjugated With a label to permit detection of any complex formed With the target in the sample. In another option , a second reagent is proVided that is capable of combining With the ﬁrst reagent after it has found its target and thereby supplying the detectable label. For example , labeled anti - mouse IgG may be proVided as a secondary reagent for use With intact ( 1C. Labeled aVidin may be pr0Vided as a secondary reagent When the primary reagent has been conjugated With biotin. The kits can be employed to test a Variety of biological samples , including both liquid samples , cell suspensions and tissue samples. Suitable assays using ( 1C that can be supplied in kit form include th0se described herein. Each reagent is supplied in a solid form or dissolVed / suspended in a liquid buffer suitable for inVentory storage , and later for exchange or addition into the reaction medium When the test is performed. Suitable packaging is proVided. The kit can optionally proVide additi0nal comp0nents that are useful in the procedure. These optional components include , but are not limited to , buﬁers , capture reagents , deVeloping reagents , labels , reacting surfaces , means for detection , control samples , instructions , and interpretiVe information.

The folloWing examples are proVided to illustrate but not limit the claimed inVention. EXAMPLE 1. Method of Obtaining Mab Hl1. Mab NBGM1 / H11 ( “H11” ) , is a human monocl0nal IgM antibody reactiVe against the folloWing human tumor tissues and corresponding tumor cell lines : glioma , malignant melanoma , colon aden0carcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma. In Vitro characterization of Mab NBGM1 / H11 is shoWn in Example 2. Fusion of H11 Was accomplished by fusing 8><l06 peripheral blood lymphocytes 0btained from a 64 year old male With a loW grade glioma With the TM - H2 - SP2 human myeloma cell line. The TM - H2 - SP2 cell line is the immunoglobulin nonsecreting subline of the IgG ( K ) parental cell line TM - H2 , a hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( EC 2.4.2.8 ) - deﬁcient deriVatiVe of an unkn0Wn human myeloma - like line selected in O.8% methylcellulose for its resistance to 6 - thioguanine ( 6 ng / mL ) and failure to groW in hypoxanthine - aminopterin - thymidine medium. The karyotype of TM - H2 - SP2 is 46 : 2 , XX. The resultant Viable hybridoma cells Were split among 40 microWells at a density of 2><105 cells / mL and 0.2 mL / Well. The frequency of outgrthh from ﬁisi0n Hll Was lZ of 40 ( 30% ) potential hybridoma - containing Wells. Outgrthh resulting from sustained grthh is deﬁned as prolonged grthh With culture expansion for periods longer than 3 months ; instances of hybridoma grthh failure occurring later than 3 months post - fusion Were not obserVed. Screening of hybridoma clones Was performed by antigen - capture enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) in microtiter plates using polyclonal anti - human IgM or I gG as coating antigen. A hybridoma culture supernatant Was positiVe if the measured optical density ( O. D. ) Value exceeded the mean background leVel of a control culture supernatant by greater than tWo standard deViations. Selection of hybridoma clone NBGMl / H1l Was performed by cell - ﬁxed ELISA. Culture supernatants from 6 microtiter Wells , Which tested high for I gM or IgG secretion , Were screened against preVi0usly attached and ﬁxed human tumor cell lines : Glioblastoma ( SKMG - 1 and D - 54MG ) ; melanoma ( A - 375 ) ; and colon aden0carcin0ma ( SK - CO - 1 ) . A hybridoma supematant Was considered to be positiVe if the measured O. D. Value exceeded the mean background leVel of control culture supernatants by greater than tWo standard deViations. Mab produced by hybridoma NBGM1 / Hll continues to be reactiVe against these tumor cell lines. The “H11” antibodies are IgM ( K ) . Characterization 0f the hybridoma NBGMl / Hl1 seed bank Was performed by Microbiological Associates ( RockVille , Md. ) . The cells tested negatiVe for ( 1 ) bacterial and fungal c0ntamination , ( 2 ) myc0plasma c0ntamination , ( 3 ) HIV - l and HIV - 2 antigens and ( 4 ) HTLV - l and HTLV - 2 antigens. The methods used for the characterization of Mab NBGM1 / H11 include : antigen - capture ELISA , antigen ELISA , cell - ﬁxed ELISA , ﬁoW cytometry , immunoper0xidase staining of human tumor cell lines and immunohistochemistry of human tumor and normal tissues ( see folloWing examples ) .

Binding of Mab H11 to Human Glioblastoma ( SKMG - l ) and Melanoma ( A375 ) Cell Lines by FloW Cyt0metric Analysis. In order to determine the binding of Mab H11 to tumor cells , tumor cells groWing in T - ﬁasks Were detached by incubation With PBS - EDTA. Cells Were collected by loW speed centrifugati0n , Washed With ice - cold PBS - 1% FBS , centrifuged and the supernatant aspirated. The cell pellet Was resuspended in culture medium spiked With one of the folloWing : a control human melanoma IgM ; hybridoma NBGM1 / H11 culture supernatant ; 0r PBS containing puri - ﬁed Mab Hll ; and incubated on ice f0r 30 minutes. After incubation , the cells Were collected by centrifugation , Washed by resuspension in PBS - FBS and centrifuged. The cell pellet Was then incubated for 30 min. With FITCconjugated goat anti - human IgM. After incubation , the cells Were Washed With PBS - FBS. Finally , the cells Were resuspended in PBS - FBS propidium iodide ( PI ) Was added and the cells Washed. PI - p0sitiVe and FITC - positiVe cells Were analyzed by ﬁoW cytometry. The results of the ﬁoW cytometric analyses are shoWn in FIGS. 2 , 3 and 4. These results indicate that crude and puriﬁed forms of Mab H11 bind to a cell surface - associated antigen ( s ) expressed on liVe human tumor cell lines , including glioblastoma , melan0ma , breast adenocarcin0ma and colon adenocarcinoma. EXAMPLE 3. Binding 0f Mab H1l to Freeze - ThaW Extracts 0f Human Tumor Cell Lines by ELISA Analysis. In order to determine the ability of Hll to bind speciﬁ - cally to human tumor antigen ( s ) , ELISA plates Were coated With human tumor cell extracts prepared by repeated freezing and thaWing of glioblastoma ( SKMG - l ) , breast adenocarcinoma ( BT - 20 , MB - 468 and MB - 453 ) , colon adenocarcinoma ( SK - CO - l and HT - 29 ) cells. The coated ELISA plates Were incubated for 16—l 8 hours at 2—8° C. The plates Were blocked With PBS - 3% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature. Then the plates Were incubated With either Mab Hll in PBS or control IgM in PBS or culture medium for 2 hrs at room temperature. The plates Were Washed and incubated With biotinylated anti - human IgM folloWed by incubation With biotinylated anti - human IgM folloWed by incubation With streptaVidin - c0njugated alkaline phosphatase for 1 hr. After Washing , p - nitrophenyl phosphate substrate Was added to each plate and , after incubati0n , the plates Were read at 405 nm in an ELISA plate reader. The binding 0f Mab H11 to the tum0r cell extracts is shoWn in FIGS. 5 and 6. These results indicate that Mab H1l binds to tumor cell extracts prepared from glioblastoma , breast adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma cells in a dose - dependent manner. EXAMPLE 4. Binding of Mab H1l to Human Tumor Cells Determined by Immunoperoxidase Staining. In order t0 determine immun0reactiVity of H11 , the folloWing experiment Was performed. Tum0r cells Were. tumor cell lines as determined by ﬂow cyt0metry , immu - 65 groWn in 24 - Well plates on coVerslips for 48—96 hrs. The. noperoxidase staining , cell - ﬁxed ELISA and antigen ELISA ( i. e. , tumor cell freeze - thaW extracts ) are presented below. cells Were Washed With PBS , ﬁxed With formaldehyde and incubated With 5% nonnal goat serum on PBS for 30 min. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 39. After Washing , the cells Were incubated for 2 hrs With either hybridoma NBGMl / H11 culture supernatants or puriﬁed Mab H1l ( l0 pg / mL ) in PBS or culture medium spiked With contr0l human myeloma IgM ( 10 pg / mL ) for 2 hrs. The cells Were then Washed and incubated With anti - human IgM conjugated to HRP. Finally , the cells Were Washed , incubated With DAB substrate to Visualize Mab H1l binding , counterstained With hematoxylin and mounted in GVA. The results of the immunoreactiVity of Mab H11 are shoWn in Table 3 Where reactiVity is indicated as negatiVe ( —— ) , Weak positiVe ( + ) , positiVe ( + + ) , str0ng positiVe ( + + + ) . These results indicate that , as determined by immunoperoxidase staining , the epitope recognized by Mab H1l is expressed by a number of different types of human tumor cells and cell lines.

Binding of Mab Hl1 to Human Turnor Cell Lines Determined by Cell - Fixed ELISA. The binding of Hl1 to human tumor cells and cell lines Was also determined by cell - ﬁxed ELISA. GroWing tumor cells Were detached from the T - ﬁask surface by incubating With EDTA - PBS. Cells Were collected by centrifugati0n , Washed With PBS , resuspended in culture medium , counted , and 50 pl of cell suspension containing 5 , 000il0 , 000 cells placed in each Well of 96 - Well ELISA plates. After alloWing the cells to attach to the plates , the culture supernatants Were rem0Ved and the plates Were blocked With PBS - BSA. The cells Were then incubated With different concentrations ( 1720 pg / mL ) of either Mab H1l or control human myeloma IgM for 2 hrs. After incubation , the plates Were Washed , incubated With biotin - conjugated goat anti - human IgM , Washed again and incubated With streptaVidin - conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Finally , the plates Were Washed , incubated With p - nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and read at 405 nm in an ELISA plate reader. 10. 15. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 40. Results of the reactiVity of Mab H11 to human tumor cell lines by cell - ﬁxed ELISA are shoWn in Table 4 and FIG. 7. In Table 4 , Control IgM lO pg / mL and H11 lO pg / mL Were used for testing the reactiVity , and Values are giVen as absorbance at 405 nm1standard deViation. These results indicate that : 1 ) Mab H11 reacts strongly With glioblastoma cells ( SKMG - 1 ) , eVen at a loW concentration of 1 pg / mL , Whereas control IgM at 20 pg / mL d0es n0t react With SKMG - 1 cells ; and 2 ) Mab H11 recognizes the tumor antigen ( s ) present on numerous tumor cell lines ( breast adenocarcinoma , colon adenocarcinoma , malignant melanoma , neuroblastoma , glioblastoma , lung adenocarcinoma , small cell lung carcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma ) . The degree for Mab reactiVity Varies both With the type of cancer and the tumor cell lines. The reactiVity of Mab H11 for cancer and tum0r cells Was betWeen three and ten times greater than that of the contr0l IgM. TABLE 4. . ReactiVity ( O. D. at 405 nm ) . . . . . .

Immunohistochemistry Was used to determine H1l speci - ﬁcity for micr0 - anatomical detail and heter0geneity in tissues and tumors. Limitations of this technique include possible false negatiVe results due to loW leVels of expres - si0n of the m0lecule under study , as Well as false positiVe results ( cross - reactiVity ) due to antibody - binding to similar epitopes or epitopes shared by other antigens. To address these limitations , this study Was carried out at the highest concentration of antibody that did not shoW non - speciﬁc binding. This alloWed for detection of all leVels of crossreactiVity in different tissues. Also , ﬁxation analysis established the best combination of antigenic staining intensity and morphological preserVation. The present example presents results obtained from IMPATH Inc. , NeW York , retained to study the cellular speciﬁcity and antigen expres - si0n of Hll , on a selected panel of cryostat - cut frozen sections of normal and tumor tissues. The study used an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Histologically normal human tissues Were obtained from surgical and autopsy specimens. These fresh tissues Were embedded in OCT ( Miles Laboratories , Inc. , NaperVille , Ill. ) in cryomolds , snap - frozen in isopentane , cooled by liquid nitrogen. The tissues from IMPATHs frozen tissue bank Were cut at 5 microns , placed on poly - L - lysine coated slides , air - dried , and stored at —70° C. H11 , receiVed on Wet ice and stored at 2—8° C. , Was supplied non - biotinylated at a concentration 0f 200 pg / mL , total Volume 0f 3.0 mL. A human myeloma IgM ( Pierce Cat. #31146 ) , also supplied by NoVopharm , Was used as the negatiVe control. Both antibodies Were diluted in phosphate buﬁered saline to the same Working concentrations dictated by titration analysis of antibody Hll. The peroxidaselabeled sec0ndary antibody Was a g0at anti - human IgM ( American Qualex , San Clemente , Calif. , lot #A112PN ) diluted in PBS to l : 500. Immunoperoxidase Techniques : Immunohistochemical studies Were performed using an indirect immunoperoxidase method. The cry0stat cut sections Were rem0Ved fr0m the —70° C. freezer , air - dried and ﬁxed acc0rding to the ﬁxation protocol ( ﬁxation details , proVided beloW ) . Tissue sections Were blocked for 10 minutes With 5% normal goat serum diluted in PBS , then incubated With the primary antibody oVernight at 4° C. Slides Were Washed in PBS , folloWed by a Wash With 0.5% TWeen / PBS soluti0n , then PBS again. Endogenous peroxidase actiVity Was blocked With a 30 minute 3% hydrogen peroxide / methanol incubation , folloWed by 3 Washes of PBS. The sections Were then incubated. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 42. With goat anti - human IgM ( peroxidase - labeled ) secondary antibody f0r 15 minutes , at room temperature , and Washed in PBS as described aboVe. The peroxidase reacti0n Was Visualized by incubating tissue sections for 2—5 minutes With 3 , 3 - diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride ( DAB ) ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo. ) . Tissue sections Were th0r0ughly Washed , c0unterstained With a modiﬁed Harris hematoxylin ( Fisher Scien - tiﬁc , FairlaWn , N. J. ) dehydrated through graded alcohols , cleared in xylene , and coVerslipped. Tissues that demonstrated high leVels of background staining With the negatiVe control antibody Were repeated With more extensiVe Washing. Human breast carcin0ma ( F95 - 036 ) , supplied by IMPATH , Was the positiVe control for H1l. NegatiVe controls substituted the primary test antibody With puriﬁed human myel0ma IgM. The purpose of the ﬁxati0n analysis Was t0 establish the conditions Which pr0Vide the optimal combinati0n of antigenic staining intensity and morphological preserVation. The positiVe control tissue Was tested With ﬁVe ﬁxation protocols , including no ﬁxation. The ﬁxation protocols tested Were lO% neutral buifered f0rmalin ( 23—25° C. ) , acetone ( 2—8° C. ) , methyl / acetone ( 1 : 1 V / V , 2—8° C. ) and 95% ethanol ( 23725° C. ) . For this study , 10% neutral buffered formalin ( NBF ) gaVe optimal results for H11. Using lO% NBF as the ﬁxatiVe , serial antibody dilutions ( 20.0 pg / mL to 0. l pg / mL ) Were tested on the positiVe control , human breast carcin0ma. A c0ncentrati0n of l0.0 pg / mL of antibody H1l gaVe optimal results—maximum staining intensity Without signiﬁcant background staining of the negatiVe control. The results obtained are depicted in Tables 5 and 6. Table 5 depicts Hll reactiVity on normal tissues and Table 6 depicts H1l reactiVity 0n human tumors. . . TABLE 5 Tested Range of.

The results obtained indicate that Weak ( 1 + ) to strong ( 3 + ) reactiVity Was obserVed in oVer 70% of the positiVe contr0l sample. The antigen recognized by Hll has a restricted pattern of distributi0n. H11 Was largely unreactiVe With normal human tissues tested in the IMPATH system. All simple epithelial cells , as Well as the stratiﬁed epithelia and squamous epithelia of diIferent organs Were found to be unreactiVe. ReactiVity Was also not seen in neuroectodennal cells , including those in the brain , spinal cord and peripheral nerVes. Mesenchymal elements such as skeletal and smooth muscle cells , ﬁbroblasts , and end0thelial cells Were negatiVe. Tissues of lymphoid origin including bone marroW , lymph node , spleen , and thymus Were largely unreactiVe With antibody Hl1. Weak ( 1 + ) reactiVity Was obserVed in rare cells in one specimen of bone marroW and in the germinal centers of one of three specimens of tonsil tested. P0sitiVe immunoreactiVity Was obserVed in alm0st all specimens of tumor tested including breast , colon , glioma , gastric , lung ( adeno , squamous , and small cell ) , lymphoma , melanoma , oVarian , and prostate. ReactiVity Was seen in 10% to greater than 95% of the tumor cells present in these specimens ; staining intensity ranged from Weak ( 1 + ) to strong ( 3 + ) . Antibody H11 Was , hoWeVer , unreactiVe With all three specimens of sarcoma tested. Some but not all normal counterparts 0f the tumor cells , When present in the specimens , Were reactiVe With Hl l . A feW normal cells present in breast , gastric and prostate carcinoma Were reactiVe With antibody H11. The large granular cells that Were reactiVe With antibody H11 are belieVed to be inﬁammatory cells of the eosinophile - mast cell lineage. In summary , antibody Hl1 is largely unreactiVe With normal human tissues With the exception 0f s0me normal tissues present in tumors. The H11 antibody detects an antigen that is expressed in almost all of the tumors tested. EXAMPLE 7. H11 Cloning , Expression and Immunologic ReactiVity. In order to determine the ability of Hl1 - scFV antibody fragments to bind speciﬁcally to cancer cells , the folloWing experiments Were performed. The single chain antibody constructs Were made by the folloWing procedure. Primers speciﬁc to the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the Hl1 kappa and mu V regions Were synthesized on an. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 44. Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. All the primers contained a restriction endonuclease site for cloning. Primers 5 and 6 also contained additional nucleotides that encode a ( SGGGG ) 3 linker.

PCR reactions Were carried out using primers 1 and 2 for the kappa dimer , primers 3 and 4 f0r the mu dimer , primers 1 and 6 f0r the kappa monomer and primers 4 and 5 for the mu monomer. The PCR fragments Were then puriﬁed and digested With their respectiVe restriction endonucleases. The coding nucleotides are depicted in SEQ ID NOS : 13 and 16 and the complementary nucleotides are depicted in SEQ ID NOS : 15 and 18 , respectiVely. The expression Vector pSJ F1 containing a 1ibo some binding site , OmpA signal peptide sequence , c - myc ( 9E10 ) detecti0n tag and histidine tail ( See FIG. 8 ) Was prepared by cutting With Bbs1 and BamH1. The mon0mer and dimer constructs Were assembled by ligating the respectiVe kappa and mu fragments into pSJF1 and transforming them into competent TGl E. c0li. Resulting colonies Were screened by colony PCR and restriction endonuclease digests to conﬁrm the correct size inserts and the sequences Were Ve1iﬁed by dideoxy ﬁuorescent sequencing. Transformed TG1 containing either the Hl1 monomer or dimer expression plasmid Were shaken at 26° C. for 24 hours folloWed by the addition IPTG to a ﬁnal concentration of 0. l pM. The cells Were incubated for a further l6 hours and then harVested by centrifugation. The periplasmic proteins containing the Hll antibody Were released by treatment With sucr0se buﬁ°er ( 25% sucrose , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 ) folloWed by ice cold shock buffer ( 10 mM Tris 8.0 , 0.5 mM MgCl2 ) . Expression Was Veriﬁed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western Blotting. The antibody Was puriﬁed using a nickel - charged column ( Pharmacia HiTrap chelating column ) and the bound antibody Was eluted With an increasing gradient of imidazole. The puriﬁed antibody Was dialyzed against PBS / 0.02% sodium azide and c0ncentrated to 0.5 mg / mL. The antigenic similarities betWeen Mab H11 and H1l - scFV Were also determined by cell ﬁxed ELISA. ELISA plates coated With A375 cells Were incubated With Mab Hl l , control IgM , Hll - scFV or control BGA - scFV folloWed by. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 45. incubation With rabbit anti - human IgM antibody or rabbit anti - scFV antibody as appropriate. The detection Was by goat anti - rabbit IgG - horse radish peroxidase folloWed by substrate. The results , shoWn in FIG. 9 , demonstrate a high aﬁinity of both H11 IgM and H11 - scFV , and a loW aﬁ‘inity of both the c0ntrol IgM and BGA - SL - 6. In order to determine the speciﬁcity of bi0tinylated HllscFV relatiVe to a bi0tinylated contr0l scFV , the folloWing experiment Was perf0rmed. Human tumor cells Were ﬁxed t0 ELISA plates and incubated With either biotinylated H11 - scFV or biotinylated BGA scFV ( control ) as described aboVe. Biotinylated H11 - scFV also demonstrated a much greater aﬁinity ( betWeen 8 - and 50 - fold ) for tumor cell lines than the control in cell ﬁxed ELISA. Data corresponding to a concentration of 2.5 pg / mL of H1l - scFV or BGA scFV is shoWn in Table 8 and FIG. 10. FIG. 11 illustrates the portion of Table 8 related to the titration of reactiVity of biotinylated Hl l - scFV for the binding to lymphoma cells Daudi , Ramos , CA - 46 and CCRFCEM cells. At eVery concentration tested ( 1.25 to 10 pg / mL ) , Hl1 - scFV demonstrated a high aﬁinity for lymphoma cells , but BGA scFV did not. TABLE 8. . Tumor Cell Lines. ReactiVity ( O.

These expression Vectors haVe separate insertional sites for the sequences encoding the light and heaVy antibody chains. A high leVel of constitutiVe expression 0f both the heaVy and light chains is directed by the cytomegal0Virus imediate%arly ( CMV ) enhancer / promoter. A chimeric intron comprising the 5 ' donor site of the ﬁrst intron of the human B - globin and the 3 ' acceptor site from the intron 0f an immunogl0bulin gene ( heaVy chain Variable region ) is located d0Wnstream fr0m the promoter Which has frequently been shoWn to enhance gene expression leVels. Polyadenylation of mRNAs are proVided by the poladenylation signal from the simian Virus 40 ( SV40 ) . The plasmids als0 contain the gene enc0ding dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) and can thus be groWn in Chinese hamster oVary ( CHO ) DHFR deﬁcient cells. Ampliﬁcation using methotrexate , a folate analogue and potent DHFR inhibitor , results in ampliﬁcation of the DHFR gene and its ﬁanking sequences ( namely , the light and heaVy chains of the antibody in the construct ) . A stepWise increase in methotrexate ( from about 0.0l nM to about 800 nM ) concentration can produce Very high leVels of protein from the target gene ( s ) . The constructs also contain a gene Which confers antibiotic resistance Was a selectable marker , either neomycin or zeomycin is used. The Vectors are shoWn in FIGS. 15 and 16.

EXAMPLE ll Hll Binding to Cancer Cell Lines. The binding aﬁinities of Hll IgM and Hll - scFV for Various human cancer cell lines Were determined by labeling H11 antibodies With either radi0actiVe i0dine or radioactiVe indium. 125 I - H1 1 - scFV Was prepared With speciﬁc actiVities of 7 , 20 or lS0 pCi / pg and lz5I - H1l IgM With 0.6 pCi / pg Were obtained. In addition , 111In - Hl l - scFV haVing a speciﬁc actiVity of l3 and 38 pCi / pg Was prepared as described in. US 7 , l66 , 286 B2. 53. Example 12. The scFV 3B1 , Which does not recognize the C - antigen , Was used as a control to indicate non - speciﬁc binding and Was labeled With lS0 pCi / pg. lZ5I - Hll - scFV Was puriﬁed using a P - 2 minicolumn and analyzed by paper chromatography in 85% methanol as shoWn in FIG. 17. lz5I - H11 IgM Was puriﬁed using a Sephadex G - 50 mini - c0lumn ( Pharmacia ) and analyzed by paper chromotography in 85% methanol as shoWn in FIG. 18. A Sephadex G - 50 column Was used to purify lllIn - Hl ll scFV Which Was then analyzed by ITLC - SG in 0. l M Citrate as sh0Wn in FIG. 19. Results of Hll binding are shoWn in FIGS. 13 and 14. FIG. 13 shoWs the speciﬁc binding of 125I - Hll - scFV to LSl74T human colon cancer cells. FIG. 14 shoWs the total binding of lllIn - H11 - scFV to A375 cells. The results obtained indicate that Hll binds speciﬁcally to both LTl 74T and human melanoma cells. Hll also binds , but With loWer aﬁinity , to the breast cancer cell line. EXAMPLE lZ Tumor Imaging With lllIndium - DTPA - Hll - scFV. H11 - scFV Was conjugated With the bycyclic anhydride of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( DTPA ) at a molar ratio of lO : l ( DTPA : Hl l - scFV ) resulting in a substitution leVel of 2 moles of DTPA per mole of Hll - scFV. DTPA - Hll - scFV Was puriﬁed from excess DTPA on a Sephadex G - 25 ( Pharmacia ) mini - column and reconcentrated to lO mg / mL using a Centricon - 30 microconcentrator ( Amicon ) . The DTPAHll - scFV Was radiolabeled to a speciﬁc actiVity of 25 mCi / mg With lllIndium acetate. Uninc0rporated lllIn Was remoVed using a Sephadex G - 25 minicolumn. The 111Indium acetate Was prepared from 111Indium chloride ( Nordion ) and l M acetate buffer at pH 6.0. The radiochemical purity 0f the ﬁnal lllIn - DTAP - Hll - scFV Was greater than 99% as measured by thin layer silica gel chromatography in lO0 mM sodium citrate pH 5.0. FIG. 19 shoWs the puriﬁcation and TLC. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 54. A female nude mouse With an existing subcutaneous A3 75 melanoma xenograft on the right lateral side and a subcutaneous HT - 29 human colon cancer xenograft in the midabdominal region Was injected intraVenously in the tail Vein With lO0 pCi of lllIn - DTAP - Hll - scFV. The mouse Was immediately placed under the gamma camera ( Siemans ZL3700 ) interfaced With a GE Star 4000i computer and a dynamic acquisition Was obtained for l20 minutes , for a total of 480 frames of 15 seconds each. The frames Were then combined into 12x10 minute images. The A375 tumor Was Visible on the right lateral side of the mouse as early as 30 minutes post - injection. Region - of - interest analysis of the tW0 tum0rs shoWed that the A375 tumor accumulated radioactiVity throughout the 120 minute study , Whereas the HT - 29 tumor accumulated radioactiVity for the ﬁrst hour and then the radioactiVity concentration remained relatiVely constant. FIG. 20 shoWs 12 frames and the tWo arr0Ws 0n the b0ttom right hand frame , taken at l20 minutes , shoW the accumulation of radioactiVity in the tWo tumors. The narroW arroW points to the A375 tumor , and the broad arroW points to the HT - 29 tumor. Normal tissues Visible on the images include the heart , liVer , kidneys and bladder. The heart is Visible due to circulating am0unts of radioactiVity , and the kidneys and bladder are Visible due to renal elimination of lllIn - DTAPHll - scFV. The small amount of liVer uptake may be due to blood ﬁoW to the liVer or to partial binding of lllIn - DTAPHll - scFV to the liVer. Although the foregoing inVention has been described in some detail by Way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity and understanding , it Will be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain changes and modiﬁcations may be practiced. Therefore , the description and examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the inVention , Which is delineated by the appended claims. .
