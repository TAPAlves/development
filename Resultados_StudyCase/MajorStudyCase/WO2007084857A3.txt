This app1ication claims the beneﬁt of priority to U. S. . provisional app1ication 60 / 759 , 124 , ﬁ1ed January 13 , 2006 , which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Government Support. Thisinvention Was made With government support under Grant number R01 AG19972 aWarded by the National Institutes of Hea1th. The government has certain rights in this invention. Background. Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that cata1yze phosphory1ation of the hydroxyl group of speciﬁc tyrosine , serine , 0r threonine residues in proteins. Typica11y , such phosphorylation dramaticaﬂy perturbs the function of the protein , and thus protein kinases are pivotalin the regu1ation of a wide variety of ce11ular processes , inc1uding metabo1ism , ce11pro1iferation , ce11 differentiation , and ce11 survivaL Of the many different ce11u1ar ﬁJnctions in Which the activity of protein kinases is known to be required , some processes represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention for certain disease states. Tvvo eXamples are angiogenesis and cell - cycle controI , in Which protein kinases p1ay a ‘pivota1role ; these processes are essential for the growth of so1id tuniors as we1l as for other diseases. Protein kinases p1ay a crucia1ro1e in cel1 - cyc1e contro1. Uncontroﬂed cel1 pro1iferation is the insignia of cancer. Cel1 proliferation in response to various stimu1i is manifested by a de—regu1ation of the ce11 division cycle , the process by Which ce11s mu1tip1y and divide. Tumor cells typically have damage to the genes thatdirect1y or indirect1y regulate progression through the cell division cyc1e. Agents that reduce and / or prevent unc0ntro11ed ce11 death are needed for treating cancer and other disorders characterized by uncontroHed ce1l prohferation. Further , there remains an unmet need for treating and. preventing disorders that are characterized by uncontro11ed ce1l pro1iferation. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2007 / 084857. PCT / US2007 / 060504.

' Examnle 1 : Resveratrol inhibits certain kinases. We have screened resveratro1 against a pane1 of 100 kinases and discovered a striking speciﬁcity as compared to known kinase inhibitors. Kinase reactions were performed 111 the presence of 10 or lO0 11M ATP and With concentrations of resveratro1 of = 0.0111M , 0.0 , 3p. M 0.111M , 0. , 311M 1uM , 311M , 10uM , 30uMandl00pM. 15. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2007 / 084857 PCT / US2007 / 060504. The results are shown in the attached ﬁgures." The results show in particu1ar that resveratro1 is a speciﬁc inhibitor of JAK2 , Pi1n71 , Pim - 2 , p70S6K , NLK and Rsk2. Rsk2 was inhibited about 68% with 20 11M resveratro1. ‘. The data generated ' indicates that resveratro1 1s a kinase inhibitor with more. selectivity than previous1y thought. Most of the kinases m the screen , including the. __ previously identiﬁed resveratro1 targets Src and PKC ( 1 ) , are either not inhibited or only. weakly inhibited by resveratro1 at a concentration of 20 micromo1ar. This concentration is we11 above the serum 1evels expected to be achievable in animals fo11owing ora1 or intravenous administration ( 2 ) . = A. Interesting1y , the best targets found in our screen are kinases be1ieved to play a role in various human pathologies including cancers , neurodegenerative disorders , cardiac hypertrophy , and other diseases. Most 1mportant1y , JAK2 and Pim - 1 / 2 are key players in a signa1ing cascade that is critical to the development of many 1eukemias and 1ymphomas ( 3 ) . Other disease—related targets inc1ude NLK , S6K1 , and Rsk2." The IC5 0s of resveratrol for a11 of these k111ases are signifcantly lower than those of the best currently reported targets. Based on our resu1ts , resveratrol may be usefu1 for inhibiting the Pim gene fami1y ( responsible for more than 50% of the transforming events in 1eukemias and lymphomas ) as well as the upstream kinase IAK2 in hematopoietic cancers. Current research suggests that this may have a profound impact on the survival and growth of tumor ce11s. Due to its ro1e in regu1ating 1ymphoid surviva1 during the 1mmune response , Pim inhibitors 11ke resveratro1 may also be useful m the treatment of autoimmune diseases. There 1s a1so some recent evidence that Pims may p1ay a bigger role than previously suspected outside of the hematopoetic system , including upregulation in prostate cancer. In the future it may become apparent that Pims p1ay a more globa1 role in tumorigenesis and thus provide more therapeutic applications for resveratrol. . The inhibition of the Pim gene fami1y , which can contribute to the transforming events 111 human leukemias and 1ymphomas ( 7 ) , is especially exciting , as the IC50 ' s are . 87111M and 1490 nM for Pim - 1 and Pim— 2 respectively. At this point resveratrol could be considered the most se1ective Pim family inh1bitor , as LY294002 , the only known Pim inhibitor ( 3 ) , is quite promiscuous ( and m fact , is marketed as a PI3K inhibitor ) . H Resveratro1 on the other hand , displays no inhibition of PI3K or most other kinases at. concentrations up to 20 micromo1ar. Pim overexpression has been shown m diffuse B cell. ' 16. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2007 / 084857 PCT / US2007 / 060504. lymphoma ( 3 ) , chronic lymphocytic 16u1<emia ( 4 ) , non - Hodgkin lymphoma ( 4 , 5 ) and ' prostate cancer , and FLT3 - mediated acute mye1ogenous leukemia ( 3 ) . Pim has a1so recently been shown to be invo1ved in non—pathologic expansion during the immune response ( 6 , 7 , : 8 ) . Knowing the importance of Pim as a transforming event in human cancers of the hematcpoietic system , resveratro1 , its derivatives , and structural neighbors may be useful as inhibitors of Pims in the treatment of lymphoid tumors. Additionally , "resveratrol ' s effects on JAK2 / STAT3 signal1ing through inhibition of JAK2 , at an IC50 of 147O 11M , cou1d provide oooperative or possibly synergistic effects on pro1ifera1ion and apoptosis in tumor ce1Is especia1ly in the hematopoietic system ( 3 ) . I. Example 2 : Dose dependent inh1bition of the growth of hematopoietic cel1 line FL5.12 by resveratrol. . Hematopoietic cel1 11ne FL5. 12 cells were seed at equa1 density and grown in the presence of IL - 3 , a growth factor. Ce1ls were then treated for 24 hours with 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 100 11M resveratrol. Cells were counted with a Coulter partic1e counter to determine cell 1 inhibition by resveratrol. Figure 6 is a graphshowing dose dependent inhibition of FL5.12 cel1 growthby resveratro1. I .
