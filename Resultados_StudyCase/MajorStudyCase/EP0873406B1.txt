[ 0001 ] The present invention re|ates to a nove| po|ypeptide which is induced by a neuroactive drug , to sequences encoding this po|ypeptide and to uses thereof. [ 0002 ] Damaged ce||s , ce||s receiving inadequate trophic support or conf|icting signa|s , or deprived of their targets e|iminate themse|ves by means of programmedceI / death or apoptosis , |eading to theirc|ean demise , |eaving no traces. Evidence is accumu|ating that neurona| ce|| death in many neurodegenerative diseases inc|uding A|zheimer ' s , Parkinson ' s , Huntington ' s disease , amyotrophic |atera| sc|erosis , cerebe||ar degeneration , and o|igodendrocyte death in mu| - tip|e sc|erosis , is associated with apoptosis. Rescuing ce||s from apoptosis may ha|t progression of neurodegenerative diseases , provided the rescued ce||s remain functiona|. [ 0003 ] ( - ) - Depreny|® ( Formu|a 1 ; referred to herein as Depreny|® ) de|ays the progression of Parkinson ' s disease and rescues neurones from presumab|y apoptotic ce|| death in a number of in vivo paradigms ( death of facia| motoneurones after axotomy ; destruction of dopaminergic ce||s in substantia nigra by MPTP or MPP + ; death of CA1 hippocampa| neurones after uni|atera| carotid occ|usion fo||owed by a brief period of hypoxia ; death of hippocampa| pyramida| ce||s after systemic kainate administration ; death of retina| gang|ion ce||s after optic nerve crush ) as we|| as in vitro in trophic factor deprived PC12 ce||s and o|igodendrocytes by an as yet unidentified mechanism. mNW. [ 0004 ] Depreny|® is metabo|ised via ( - ) - desmethy|depreny| to ( - ) - methamphetamine and ( - ) - amphetamine , both of which potent|y antagonise Depreny|® ' s rescuing effects in vivo and in vitro. Therefore , compounds with equa| or better neurorescuing properties than Depreny|® , but unab|e to generate antagonistic metabo|ites , may show a higher therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. [ 0005 ] WO950064 describes compositions of and methods for obtaining and using a po|ypeptide that affects programmed vertebrate ce|| death. W. Tatton ( Movements Disorders , 1994 , 9 , supp|ement 1 ) describes that Deprenyreduces neurona| apoptosis. [ 0006 ] We have now found that Depreny|® induces a nove| po|ypeptide in neura| ce||s. This po|ypeptide has the structure given in SEQ |D No. 1 and is referred to herein as D|P 1 ( Depreny|® ] nduced Erotein 1 ) . According|y , we provide D|P 1 , which has the structure shown in SEQ |D No. 1. The recited sequence is that of rat D|P 1 , but the invention re|ates to D|P 1 derived from a|| sources , inc|uding human D|P 1. Species homo|ogues of rat D|P 1 may be obtained using the recited sequence according to standard methodo|ogy , as set out be|ow. [ 0007 ] "Functiona| derivative” means that the derivative in question is at |east one functiona| determinant of D|P 1 of the present invention. Such functions inc|ude the susceptibi|ity to induction by Depreny|® , and / or at |east one in vivo function of D|P 1. For examp|e , derivatives of D|P 1 according to the invention may be ab|e to inhibit or postpone apoptotic neura| degeneration. Thus , D|P 1 as provided by the present invention inc|udes sp|ice variants encoded by mRNA generated by a|ternative sp|icing of a primary transcript , amino acid mutants , posttrans|ationa| modifications , such as g|ycosy|ation and phosphory|ation variants , and other cova|ent derivatives of D|P 1 which retain the physio - |ogica| and / or physica| properties of D| P 1. Exemp|ary derivatives inc|ude mo|ecu|es wherein the protein of the invention is cova|ent|y modified by substitution , chemica| , enzymatic , or other appropriate means with a moiety other than a natura||y occurring amino acid. Such a moiety may be a detectab|e moiety such as an enzyme or a radioisotope , or other detectab|e |abe|s , tags , toxins and genes such as oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Further inc|uded are natura||y occurring variants of D|P 1 found within a particu|ar species , preferab|y a mamma|. Such a variant may be encoded by a re|ated gene of the same gene fami|y , by an a||e|ic variant of a particu|ar gene , or represent an a|ternative sp|icing variant of the D|P 1 gene. [ 0008 ] Derivatives of D|P 1 a|so comprise mutants thereof , which may contain amino acid de|etions , additions or substitutions , subject to the requirement to maintain at |east one feature characteristic of D|P 1. Thus , conservative amino acid substitutions may be made substantia||y without a|tering the nature of D|P 1 , as may truncations from the 5 ' or 3 ' ends. D|P 1 mutants may be produced from a DNA encoding D|P 1 which has been subjected to in mm mutagenesis resu|ting e. g. in an addition , exchange and / or de|etion of one or more amino acids. For examp|e , substitutiona| , de|etiona| or insertiona| variants of D| P1 can be prepared by recombinant methods and screened forfunctionasimi|arity to the native forms of D|P 1. [ 0009 ] The protein or derivative thereof of the invention is provided in iso|ated form. "|so|ated" means that the protein. ( Formula 1 ) . 1 ' 0. 1 ' 5. 20. 25. 30. 35. 4o. 45. 50. 55. EP 0 873 406 B1. or derivative has been identified and is free of one or more components of its natura| environment. |so|ated D|P 1 inc|udes D|P 1 in a recombinant ce|| cu|ture. D|P 1 present in an organism expressing a recombinant D|P 1 gene , whether the D|P 1 protein is "iso|ated" or otherwise , is inc|uded within the scope of the present invention. [ 0010 ] D|P 1 is be|ieved to be a member of the bc| fami|y of proteins , and is c|ose|y homo|ogous to bc| xL. There are , however , characteristic differences between the two proteins which wi|| be apparent by comparing the sequence given herein with the pub|ished sequence of rat bc| xL. [ 0011 ] The po|ypeptide according to the invention is c|ose|y associated with neurodegenerative disorders and particu|ar|y apoptosis in neura| ce||s. According|y , the invention provides a composition comprising a po|ypeptide according to the invention or a modu|ator thereof for use as a medicament in the treatment or diagnosis of neura| diseases. [ 0012 ] According to a further aspect of the present invention , there is provided a nuc|eic acid encoding an N , N - dimethy| - N - 2 - propyny| - benzenethanamine induced protein ( D|P 1 ) having the sequence of SEQ |D NO : 1. |n addition to being usefu| for the production of recombinant D|P 1 protein , these nuc|eic acids are a|so usefu| as probes , thus readi|y enab|ing those ski||ed in the art to identify and / or iso|ate nuc|eic acid encoding D|P 1 of the present invention. The nuc|eic acid may be un|abe||ed or |abe||ed with a detectab|e moiety. Furthermore , nuc|eic acid according to the invention is usefu| e. g. in a method determining the presence of D|P 1 - specific nuc|eic acid , said method comprising hybridising the DNA ( or RNA ) encoding ( or comp|ementary to ) D|P 1 to test samp|e nuc|eic acid and determining the presence of D|P 1. |n another aspect , the invention provides nuc|eic acid sequence that is comp|ementary to , or hybridises under stringent conditions to , a nuc|eic acid sequence encoding D|P 1. [ 0013 ] The invention a|so provides a method for amp|ifying a nuc|eic acid test samp|e comprising priming a nuc|eic acid po|ymerase ( chain ) reaction with nuc|eic acid ( DNA or RNA ) encoding ( or comp|ementary to ) D|P 1. [ 0014 ] |n sti|| another aspect of the invention ; the nuc|eic acid is DNA and further comprises a rep|icab|e vector comprising the nuc|eic acid encoding D|P 1 operab|y |inked to contro| sequences recognised by a host transformed by the vector. Furthermore the invention provides host ce||s transformed with such a vector and a method of using a nuc|eic acid encoding D|P 1 to effect the production of D|P 1 , comprising expressing D|P 1 nuc|eic acid in a cu|ture of the transformed host ce||s and , if desired , recovering D|P 1 from the host ce|| cu|ture. [ 0015 ] Furthermore , the present invention re|ates to iso|ated D|P 1 proteins and derivatives thereof encoded by the above - described nuc|eic acids. [ 0016 ] |so|ated D|P 1 nuc|eic acid inc|udes nuc|eic acid that is free from at |east one contaminant nuc|eic acid with which it is ordinari|y associated in the natura| source of D|P 1 nuc|eic acid or in crude nuc|eic acid preparations , such as DNA |ibraries and the |ike. |so|ated nuc|eic acid thus is present in otherthan in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. However , iso|ated D|P 1 encoding nuc|eic acid inc|udes D|P 1 nuc|eic acid in ordinari|y D|P 1 - expressing ce||s where the nuc|eic acid is in a chromosoma| |ocation different from that of natura| ce||s or is othenNise f|anked by a different DNA sequence than that found in nature. [ 0017 ] |n accordance with the present invention , there are provided iso|ated nuc|eic acids , e. g. DNAs or RNAs , encoding D|P 1 of the present invention , particu|ar|y mamma|ian D|P 1 , e. g. rat or human D|P 1 , orfragments thereof. |n particu|ar , the invention provides a DNA mo|ecu|e encoding D|P 1 , or a fragment thereof. By definition , such a DNA comprises a coding sing|e stranded DNA , a doub|e stranded DNA of said coding DNA and comp|ementary DNAthereto , or this comp|ementary ( sing|e stranded ) DNA itse|f. [ 0018 ] The invention moreover provides functiona| contro| e|ements derived from the D|P 1 gene , such as promoters and enhancers. Such e|ements are usefu||y coup|ed to reporter genes and used to study the modu|ation of D|P 1 expression by neuroactive drugs at the mo|ecu|ar |eve|. D|P 1 - regu|ated transcription units may be used in ce|| - based assays , transgenic anima|s , in methods for gene therapy and other techniques described be|ow. [ 0019 ] H is understood thatthese conditions may be adapted and dup|icated using a variety of buffers , e. g. formamidebased buffers , and temperatures. Denhardt ' s so|ution and SSC are we|| known to those of ski|| in the art as are other suitab|e hybridisation buffers ( see , e. g. Sambrook , efa / . , eds. ( 1989 ) Mo|ecu|ar C|oning : A Laboratory Manua| , Co|d Spring Harbor Laboratory Press , New York or Ausube| , eta / . , eds. ( 1990 ) Current Protoco|s in Mo|ecu|ar Bio|ogy , John Wi|ey & Sons , |nc. ) . Optima| hybridisation conditions have to be determined empirica||y , as the |ength and the GC content of the probe a|so p|ay a ro|e. [ 0020 ] Given the guidance provided herein , the nuc|eic acids of the invention are obtainab|e according to methods we|| known in the art. For examp|e , a DNA of the invention is obtainab|e by chemica| synthesis , using po|ymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) or by screening a genomic |ibrary or a suitab|e cDNA |ibrary prepared from a source be|ieved to possess D|P 1 and to express it at a detectab|e |eve|. Such methods moreover permit the iso|ation of species homo|ogues of the recited rat D|P 1 by screening nuc|eic acid sources derived from different species , such as humans. [ 0021 ] Chemica| methods for synthesis of a nuc|eic acid of interest are known in the art and inc|ude triester , phosphite , phosphoramidite and H - phosphonate methods , PCR and other autoprimer methods as we|| as o|igonuc|eotide synthesis on so|id supports. These methods may be used if the entire nuc|eic acid sequence of the nuc|eic acid is known , or the sequence of the nuc|eic acid comp|ementary to the coding strand is avai|ab|e. A|ternative|y , if the target amino acid sequence is known , one may infer potentia| nuc|eic acid sequences using known and preferred coding residues for. 1 ' 0. 1 ' 5. 20. 25. 30. 35. 4o. 45. 50. 55. EP 0 873 406 B1. each amino acid residue. [ 0022 ] An a|ternative means to iso|ate the gene encoding D|P 1 is to use PCR techno|ogy as described e. g. in section 14 of Sambrook et a|. , 1989. This method requires the use of o|igonuc|eotide probes that wi|| hybridise to D|P1 nuc|eic acid. Strategies for se|ection of o|igonuc|eotides are described be|ow. [ 0023 ] Libraries are screened with probes or ana|ytica| too|s designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. For cDNA expression |ibraries suitab|e means inc|ude monoc|ona| or po|yc|ona| antibodies that recognise and specifica||y bind to D|P 1 ; o|igonuc|eotides of about 20 to 80 bases in |ength that encode known or suspected D|P 1 cDNA from the same or different species ; and / or comp|ementary or homo|ogous cDNAs or fragments thereof that encode the same or a hybridising gene. Appropriate probes for screening genomic DNA |ibraries inc|ude , but are not |imited to o|igonuc|eotides , cDNAs or fragments thereof that encode the same or hybridising DNA ; and / or homo|ogous genomic DNAs or fragments thereof. [ 0024 ] A nuc|eic acid encoding D|P1 may be iso|ated by screening suitab|e cDNA or genomic |ibraries under suitab|e hybridisation conditions with a probe , i. e. a nuc|eic acid disc|osed herein inc|uding o|igonuc|eotides derivab|e from the sequence set forth in SEQ |D No. 1. Suitab|e |ibraries are commercia||y avai|ab|e or can be prepared e. g. from ce|| |ines , tissue samp|es , and the |ike. [ 0025 ] As used herein , a probe is e. g. a sing|e - stranded DNA or RNAthat has a sequence of nuc|eotides that inc|udes between 10 and 50 , preferab|y between 15 and 30 and most preferab|y at |east about 20 contiguous bases. The nuc|eic acid sequences se|ected as probes shou|d be of sufficient |ength and sufficient|y unambiguous so that fa|se positive resu|ts are minimised. The nuc|eic acids used as probes , being derived from protein sequence , wi|| be degenerate at one or more positions. [ 0026 ] Preferred regions from which to construct probes inc|ude areas of the D|P 1 sequence which do not share homo|ogy with bc| X. Preferab|y , nuc|eic acid probes of the invention are |abe||ed with suitab|e |abe| means for ready detection upon hybridisation. For examp|e , a suitab|e |abe| means is a radio|abe|. The preferred method of |abe||ing a DNA fragment is by incorporating cc32P dATP with the K|enow fragment of DNA po|ymerase in a random priming reaction , as is we|| known in the art. O|igonuc|eotides are usua||y end - |abe||ed with g32P - |abe||ed ATP and po|ynuc|eotide kinase. However , other methods ( e. g. non - radioactive ) may a|so be used to |abe| the fragment or o|igonuc|eotide , inc|uding e. g. enzyme |abe||ing , f|uorescent |abe||ing with suitab|e f|uorophores and biotiny|ation. [ 0027 ] After screening the |ibrary , e. g. with suitab|e o|igonuc|eotide , positive c|ones are identified by detecting a hybridisation signa| ; the identified c|ones are characterised by restriction enzyme mapping and / or DNA sequence ana| - ysis , and then examined , e. g. by comparison with the sequence set forth herein , to ascertain whether they inc|ude DNA encoding a comp|ete D|P1 ( i. e. , ifthey inc|udetrans|ation initiation and termination codons ) . |f the se|ected c|ones are incomp|ete , they may be used to rescreen the same or a different |ibrary to obtain over|apping c|ones. |f the |ibrary is genomic , then the over|apping c|ones may inc|ude exons and introns. |f the |ibrary is a cDNA |ibrary , then the over - |apping c|ones wi|| inc|ude an open reading frame. |n both instances , comp|ete c|ones may be identified by comparison with the DNAs and deduced amino acid sequences provided herein. [ 0028 ] |n order to detect any abnorma|ity of endogenous D|P 1 , genetic screening may be carried out using the nuc|eotide sequences of the invention as hybridisation probes. A|so , based on the nuc|eic acid sequences provided herein antisense - type therapeutic agents may be designed. [ 0029 ] H is envisaged that the nuc|eic acid of the invention can be readi|y modified by nuc|eotide substitution , nuc|e - otide de|etion , nuc|eotide insertion or inversion of a nuc|eotide stretch , and any combination thereof. Such mutants can be used e. g. to produce a D|P 1 mutant that has an amino acid sequence differing from the D|P 1 sequences as found in nature. Mutagenesis may be predetermined ( site - specific ) or random. [ 0030 ] The cDNA or genomic DNA encoding native or mutant D|P 1 can be incorporated into vectors for further manipu|ation. As used herein , vector ( or p|asmid ) refers to discrete e|ements that are used to introduce hetero|ogous DNA into ce||s for either expression or rep|ication thereof. Se|ection and use of such vehic|es are we|| within the ski|| of the artisan. Many vectors are avai|ab|e , and se|ection of appropriate vector wi|| depend on the intended use of the vector , i. e. whether it is to be used for DNA amp|ification orfor DNA expression , the size ofthe DNAto be inserted into the vector , and the host ce|| to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function ( amp|ification of DNA or expression of DNA ) and the host ce|| for which it is compatib|e. The vector components genera||y inc|ude , but are not |imited to , one or more of the fo||owing : an origin of rep|ication , one or more marker genes , an enhancer e|ement , a promoter , a transcription termination sequence and a signa| sequence. [ 0031 ] Both expression and c|oning vectors genera||y contain nuc|eic acid sequence that enab|e the vector to rep|i - cate in one or more se|ected host ce||s. Typica||y in c|oning vectors , this sequence is one that enab|es the vector to rep|icate independent|y of the host chromosoma| DNA , and inc|udes origins of rep|ication or autonomous|y rep|icating sequences. Such sequences are we|| known for a variety of bacteria , yeast and viruses. The origin of rep|ication from the p|asmid pBR322 is suitab|e for most Gram - negative bacteria , the 2u p|asmid origin is suitab|e for yeast , and various vira| origins ( e. g. SV 40 , po|yoma , adenovirus ) are usefu| for c|oning vectors in mamma|ian ce||s. Genera||y , the origin of rep|ication component is not needed for mamma|ian expression vectors un|ess these are used in mamma|ian ce||s. 1 ' 0. 1 ' 5. 20. 25. 30. 35. 4o. 45. 50. 55. EP 0 873 406 B1. competent for high |eve| DNA rep|ication , such as COS ce||s. [ 0032 ] Most expression vectors are shutt|e vectors , i. e. they are capab|e of rep|ication in at |east one c|ass of organisms but can be transfected into another organism for expression. For examp|e , a vector is c|oned in E. co|i and then the same vector is transfected into yeast or mamma|ian ce||s even though it is not capab|e of rep|icating independent|y of the host ce|| chromosome. DNA may a|so be rep|icated by insertion into the host genome. However , the recovery of genomic DNA encoding D| P1 is more comp|ex than that of exogenous|y rep|icated vector because restriction enzyme digestion is required to excise D|P 1 DNA. DNA can be amp|ified by PCR and be direct|y transfected into the host ce||s without any rep|ication component. [ 0033 ] Advantageous|y , an expression and c|oning vector may contain a se|ection gene a|so referred to as se|ectab|e marker. This gene encodes a protein necessary forthe surviva| or growth of transformed host ce||s grown in a se|ective cu|ture medium. Host ce||s not transformed with the vector containing the se|ection gene wi|| not survive in the cu|ture medium. Typica| se|ection genes encode proteins that confer resistance to antibiotics and othertoxins , e. g. ampici||in , neomycin , methotrexate or tetracyc|ine , comp|ement auxotrophic deficiencies , or supp|y critica| nutrients not avai|ab|e from comp|ex media. [ 0034 ] As to a se|ective gene marker appropriate for yeast , any marker gene can be used which faci|itates the se - |ection for transformants due to the phenotypic expression of the marker gene. Suitab|e markers for yeast are , for examp|e , those conferring resistance to antibiotics G418 , hygromycin or b|eomycin , or provide for prototrophy in an auxotrophic yeast mutant , for examp|e the URA3 , LEU2 , LYS2 , TRP1 , or H|S3 gene. [ 0035 ] Since the rep|ication of vectors is convenient|y done in M , an E. co|i genetic marker and an E. co|i origin of rep|ication are advantageous|y inc|uded. These can be obtained from w p|asmids , such as pBR322 , B|uescript® vector or a pUC p|asmid , e. g. pUC18 or pUC19 , which contain both M rep|ication origin and m genetic marker conferring resistance to antibiotics , such as ampici||in. [ 0036 ] Suitab|e se|ectab|e markers for mamma|ian ce||s are those that enab|e the identification of ce||s competent to take up D|P 1 nuc|eic acid , such as dihydrofo|ate reductase ( DHFR , methotrexate resistance ) , thymidine kinase , or genes conferring resistance to G418 or hygromycin. The mamma|ian ce|| transformants are p|aced under se|ection pressure which on|y those transformants which have taken up and are expressing the marker are unique|y adapted to survive. |n the case of a DHFR or g|utamine synthase ( GS ) marker , se|ection pressure can be imposed by cu|turing the transformants under conditions in which the pressure is progressive|y increased , thereby |eading to amp|ification ( at its chromosoma| integration site ) of both the se|ection gene and the |inked DNA that encodes D|P 1. Amp|ification is the process by which genes in greater demand forthe production of a protein critica| for growth , together with c|ose|y associated genes which may encode a desired protein , are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of recombinant ce||s. |ncreased quantities of desired protein are usua||y synthesised from thus amp|ified DNA. [ 0037 ] Expression and c|oning vectors usua||y contain a promoter that is recognised by the host organism and is operab|y |inked to D|P 1 nuc|eic acid. Such a promoter may be inducib|e or constitutive. The promoters are operab|y |inked to DNA encoding D|P 1 by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the iso|ated promoter sequence into the vector. Both the native D|P 1 promoter sequence and many heter - o|ogous promoters may be used to direct amp|ification and / or expression of D|P 1 DNA. [ 0038 ] Promoters suitab|e for use with prokaryotic hosts inc|ude , for examp|e , the b - |actamase and |actose promoter systems , a|ka|ine phosphatase , the tryptophan ( trp ) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. Their nuc|eotide sequences have been pub|ished , thereby enab|ing the ski||ed worker operab|y to |igate them to DNA encoding D|P 1 , using |inkers or adaptors to supp|y any required restriction sites. Promoters for use in bacteria| systems wi|| a|so genera||y contain a Shine - De|gamo sequence operab|y |inked to the DNA encoding D|P 1. [ 0039 ] Moreover , the D|P 1 gene according to the invention preferab|y inc|udes a secretion sequence in order to faci|itate secretion of the po|ypeptide from bacteria| hosts , such that it wi|| be produced as a so|ub|e native peptide rather than in an inc|usion body. The peptide may be recovered from the bacteria| perip|asmic space , or the cu|ture medium , as appropriate. [ 0040 ] Suitab|e promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts may be regu|ated or constitutive and are preferab|y derived from a high|y expressed yeast gene , especia||y a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene. Thus , the promoter of the TRP1 gene , the w or ADH|| gene , the acid phosphatase ( M ) gene , a promoter of the yeast mating pheromone genes coding forthea - or a - factor or a promoter derived from a gene encoding a g|yco|ytic enzyme such as the promoter of the eno|ase , g|ycera|dehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( % ) , 3 - phospho g|ycerate kinase ( ﬂ ) , hexokinase , pyruvate decarboxy|ase , phosphofructokinase , g|ucose - 6 - phosphate isomerase , 3 - phosphog|ycerate mutase , pyruvate kinase , triose phosphate isomerase , phosphog|ucose isomerase or g|ucokinase genes , or a promoter from the TATA binding protein ( TBP ) gene can be used. Furthermore , it is possib|e to use hybrid promoters comprising upstream activation sequences ( UAS ) of one yeast gene and downstream promoter e|ements inc|uding a functiona| TATA box of another yeast gene , for examp|e a hybrid promoter inc|uding the UAS ( s ) of the yeast w gene and downstream promoter e|ements inc|uding a functiona| TATA box of the yeast % gene ( PH05 - % hybrid promoter ) . A suitab|e constitutive PHO5 promoter is e. g. a shortened acid phosphatase w promoter devoid of the upstream regu|atory. . . . . . . 1 ' 0. 1 ' 5. 20. 25. 30. 35. 4o. 45. 50. 55.

[ 0041 ] D|P 1 gene transcription from vectors in mamma|ian hosts may be contro||ed by promoters derived from the genomes of viruses such as po|yoma virus , adenovirus , fow|pox virus , bovine papi||oma virus , avian sarcoma virus , cytomega|ovirus ( CMV ) , a retrovirus and Simian Virus 40 ( SV40 ) , from hetero|ogous mamma|ian promoters such as the actin promoter or a very strong promoter , e. g. a ribosoma| protein promoter , and from the promoter norma||y associated with D|P 1 sequence , provided such promoters are compatib|e with the host ce|| systems. [ 0042 ] Transcription of a DNA encoding D|P 1 by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are re|ative|y orientation and position independent. Many enhancer sequences are known from mamma|ian genes ( e. g. e|astase and g|obin ) . However , typica||y one wi|| emp|oy an enhancer from a eukaryotic ce|| virus. Examp|es inc|ude the SV40 enhancer on the |ate side of the rep|ication origin ( bp 100 - 270 ) and the CMV ear|y promoter enhancer. The enhancer may be sp|iced into the vector at a position 5 ' or 3 ' to D|P 1 DNA , but is preferab|y |ocated at a site 5 ' from the promoter. [ 0043 ] Advantageous|y , a eukaryotic expression vector encoding D|P 1 may comprise a |ocus contro| region ( LCR ) . LCRs are capab|e of directing high - |eve| integration site independent expression of transgenes integrated into host ce|| chromatin , which is of importance especia||y where the D|P 1 gene is to be expressed in the context of a permanent|y - transfected eukaryotic ce|| |ine in which chromosoma| integration ofthe vector has occurred , in vectors designed for gene therapy app|ications or in transgenic anima|s. [ 0044 ] Suitab|e eukaryotic host ce||s for expression of D|P 1 inc|ude yeast , fungi , insect , p|ant , anima| , human , or nuc|eated ce||s from other mu|tice||u|ar organisms wi|| a|so contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabi|ising the mRNA. Such sequences are common|y avai|ab|efrom the 5 ' and 3 ' untrans|ated regions of eukaryotic or vira| DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nuc|eotide segments transcribed as po|yadeny|ated fragments in the untrans|ated portion of the mRNA encoding D|P 1. [ 0045 ] An expression vector inc|udes any vector capab|e of expressing D|P 1 nuc|eic acids that are operative|y |inked with regu|atory sequences , such as promoter regions , that are capab|e of expression of such DNAs. Thus , an expression vector refers to a recombinant DNA or RNA construct , such as a p|asmid , a phage , recombinant virus or other vector , that upon introduction into an appropriate host ce|| , resu|ts in expression of the c|oned DNA. Appropriate expression vectors are we|| known to those with ordinary ski|| in the art and inc|ude those that are rep|icab|e in eukaryotic and / or prokaryotic ce||s and thosethat remain episoma| orthose which integrate into the host ce|| genome. For examp|e , DNAs encoding D|P1 may be inserted into a vector suitab|e for expression of cDNAs in mamma|ian ce||s , e. g. a CMV enhancer - based vector such as pEVRF ( Matthias , eta / . , ( 1989 ) NAR 17 , 6418 ) . [ 0046 ] Particu|ar|y usefu| for practising the present invention are expression vectors that provide for the transient expression of DNA encoding D|P 1 in mamma|ian ce||s. Transient expression usua||y invo|ves the use of an expression vectorth at is ab|e to rep|icate efficient|y in a host ce|| , such thatthe host ce|| accumu|ates many copies ofthe expression vector , and , in turn , synthesises high |eve|s of D|P 1. For the purposes of the present invention , transient expression systems are usefu| e. g. for identifying D|P 1 mutants , to identify potentia| phosphory|ation sites , or to characterise functiona| domains of the protein. [ 0047 ] Construction ofvectors according to the invention emp|oys conventiona| |igation techniques. |so|ated p|asmids or DNA fragments are c|eaved , tai|ored , and re|igated in the form desired to generate the p|asmids required. |f desired , ana|ysis to confirm correct sequences in the constructed p|asmids is performed in a known fashion. Suitab|e methods for constructing expression vectors , preparing in vitro transcripts , introducing DNA into host ce||s , and performing ana| - yses for assessing D|P 1 expression and function are known to those ski||ed in the art. Gene presence , amp|ification and / or expression may be measured in a samp|e direct|y , for examp|e , by conventiona| Southern b|otting , Northern b|otting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA , dot b|otting ( DNA or RNA ana|ysis ) , or in situ hybridisation , using an appropriate|y |abe||ed probe based on a sequence provided herein. Those ski||ed in the art wi|| readi|y envisage how these methods may be modified , if desired. [ 0048 ] |n accordance with another embodiment of the present invention , there are provided ce||s containing the above - described nuc|eic acids. Such host ce||s such as prokaryote , yeast and higher eukaryote ce||s may be used for rep|icating DNA and producing D|P 1. Suitab|e prokaryotes inc|ude eubacteria , such as Gram - negative or Gram - positive organisms , such as E. co|i , e. g. E. co|i K - 12 strains , DH5a and HB101 , or Baci||i. Further hosts suitab|e for D|P encoding vectors inc|ude eukaryotic microbes such as fi|amentous fungi or yeast , e. g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Higher eukaryotic ce||s inc|ude insect and vertebrate ce||s , particu|ar|y mamma|ian ce||s. |n recent years propagation of vertebrate ce||s in cu|ture ( tissue cu|ture ) has become a routine procedure. Examp|es of usefu| mamma|ian host ce|| |ines are epithe|ia| or fibrob|astic ce|| |ines such as Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) ce||s , N|H 3T3 ce||s , HeLa ce||s or 293T ce||s. The host ce||s referred to in this disc|osure comprise ce||s in in vitro cu|ture as we|| as ce||s that are within a host anima|. [ 0049 ] DNA may be stab|y incorporated into ce||s or may be transient|y expressed using methods known in the art. Stab|ytransfected mamma|ian ce||s may be prepared by transfecting ce||s with an expression vector having a se|ectab|e. 1 ' 0. 1 ' 5. 20. 25. 30. 35. 4o. 45. 50. 55. EP 0 873 406 B1. marker gene , and growing the transfected ce||s under conditions se|ective for ce||s expressing the marker gene. To prepare transient transfectants , mamma|ian ce||s are transfected with a reporter gene to monitortransfection efficiency. [ 0050 ] To produce such stab|y ortransient|y transfected ce||s , the ce||s shou|d be transfected with a sufficient amount of D|P 1 - encoding nuc|eic acid to form D|P 1. The precise amounts of DNA encoding D|P 1 may be empirica||y determined and optimised for a particu|ar ce|| and assay. [ 0051 ] Host ce||s are transfected or , preferab|y , transformed with the above - captioned expression or c|oning vectors of this invention and cu|tured in conventiona| nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters , se|ecting transformants , or amp|ifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. Hetero|ogous DNA may be introduced into host ce||s by any method known in the art , such as transfection with a vector encoding a hetero|ogous DNA by the ca|cium phosphate coprecipitation technique or by e|ectroporation. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ski||ed worker in the fie|d. Successfu| transfection is genera||y recognised when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs in the host ce||. Transformation is achieved using standard techniques appropriate to the particu|ar host ce||s used. [ 0052 ] |ncorporation of c|oned DNA into a suitab|e expression vector , transfection of eukaryotic ce||s with a p|asmid vector or a combination of p|asmid vectors , each encoding one or more distinct genes or with |inear DNA , and se|ection of transfected ce||s are we|| known in the art ( see , e. g. Sambrook et at ( 1989 ) Mo|ecu|ar C|oning : A Laboratory Manua| , Second Edition , Co|d Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ) . [ 0053 ] Transfected or transformed ce||s are cu|tured using media and cu|turing methods known in the art , preferab|y under conditions , whereby D|P 1 encoded by the DNA is expressed. The composition of suitab|e media is known to those in the art , so that they can be readi|y prepared. Suitab|e cu|turing media are a|so commercia||y avai|ab|e. [ 0054 ] Whi|e the DNA provided herein may be expressed in any suitab|e host ce|| , e. g. those referred to above , preferred for expression of DNA encoding functiona| D|P 1 are eukaryotic expression systems such as bacu|ovirusbased systems and , particu|ar|y , mamma|ian expression systems , inc|uding commercia||y avai|ab|e systems and other systems known to those of ski|| in the art. [ 0055 ] |n preferred embodiments , D|P 1 encoding DNA is |igated into a vector , and introduced into suitab|e host ce||s to produce transformed ce|| |ines that express D|P 1. The resu|ting ce|| |ines can then be produced in quantity for reproducib|e qua|itative and / or quantitative ana|ysis of the effect ( s ) of potentia| drugs affecting D|P 1 function. Thus D|P 1 expressing ce||s may be emp|oyed forthe identification of compounds , particu|ar|y sma|| antagonising mo|ecu|es interfering with D|P 1 function are usefu|. An a|ternative to achieve an antagonistic effect is to re|y on over - expression of anti - sense D|P 1 RNA. Thus host ce||s expressing D|P 1 are usefu| for drug screening and it is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for identifying compounds which modu|ate and preferab|e reduce the activity of D|P 1 , said method comprising exposing ce||s containing hetero|ogous DNA encoding D|P 1 , wherein said ce||s produce functiona| D|P 1 , to at |east one compound or signa| whose abi|ity to modu|ate the activity of said D|P 1 is sought to be determined , and thereafter monitoring said ce||s for changes caused by said modu|ation. Such an assay enab|es the identification of agonists , antagonists and modu|ators of D|P 1. [ 0056 ] Ce|| - based screening assays can be designed e. g. by constructing ce|| |ines in which the expression of a reporter protein , i. e. an easi|y assayab|e protein , such as B ga|actosidase , ch|oramphenico| acety|transferase ( CAT ) or |uciferase , is dependent on D|P 1. Such an assay enab|es the detection of compounds that direct|y modu|ate D|P 1 function , e. g. compounds that induce D|P 1 , or compounds that promote other ce||u|ar functions required for the activity of D|P 1. [ 0057 ] |t has been found that D|P 1 is induced in neura| ce||s upon Depreny|®treatment. Thus the present invention a|so provides a method to exogenous|y affect D|P 1 dependent processes occurring in such ce||s. D|P 1 producing ce||s , e. g. neura| ce||s , can be contacted with a test compound , and the modu|ating effect ( s ) thereof can then be eva| - uated by comparing the D|P 1 induction response in the presence and absence of test compound , or re|ating the D|P 1 induction response of test ce||s , or contro| ce||s ( i. e. , ce||s that do not express D| P 1 ) , to the presence ofthe compound. The same strategy can be used to observe the effect of test compounds which modu|ate the downstream effects of D|P 1. [ 0058 ] The invention therefore inc|udes a method of screening a compound for an abi|ity to rescue neura| ce||s from apoptosis comprises contacting a neura| ce|| with the compound and observing the |eve|s of D|P 1 activity , an e|evated |eve| being indicative of abi|ity of the compound abi|ity to rescue neura| ce||s from apoptosis. Moreover , the invention provides a composition for rescuing neura| ce||s from apoptosis , which composition is effective to increase the activity of D|P1 in neura| ce||s. [ 0059 ] Preferab|y , D|P 1 is expressed in a tissue - specific manner , advantageous|y through the use of tissue - specific contro| sequences , such as promoters , enhancers or |ocus contro| e|ements. Particu|ar|y preferred is the TH gene promoter , which directs tissue - specifc expression in neurona| ce||s ( Joh eta / . , Mo|. Brain Res. , 1994 , § , 281 - 289 ) . Such conto| sequences may be used in association with D|P 1 conto| sequences in order to coup|e tissue specificity with responsiveness to anti - apoptotic drugs. [ 0060 ] The conto| sequences may be operab|y |inked to the D|P 1 coding sequence , or to that of a reporter gene , . 1 ' 0. 1 ' 5. 20. 25. 30. 35. 4o. 45. 50. 55.

[ 0061 ] Moreover , since the po|ypeptide according to the is associated with the apoptotic process in neura| ce||s , the invention provides a composition comprising a nuc|eic acid encoding a po|ypeptide according to the invention or an antagonist thereto for use as a medicament in the treatment or diagnosis of neura| disease. [ 0062 ] |n a preferred embodiment , there is provided a transcription unit encoding a po|ypeptide according to the invention or an antagonist thereto for use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a neura| or other condition in a subject in need thereof , for examp|e a condition invo|ving aberrant D|P 1 gene expression , by gene therapy techniques. The transcription unit provided according to the present aspect of the invention comprises regu - |atab|e contro| regions which inc|ude a promoter , together with one or more enhancers and / or LCRs. The transcription unit may be de|ivered to the subject by any suitab|e means , inc|uding vira| vectors , especia||y retrovira| vectors , adenoand adeno associated vira| vectors , non - vira| de|ivery systems , inc|uding |iposoma| and antibody targeted de|ivery systems , direct uptake of naked DNA and transfer of eX vivo transfected ce||s.
