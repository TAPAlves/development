Pharmaceutica1 compositions comprising the compounds and methods for treating , preventing and. managing various disorders are also disc1osed. . . 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 PATHOBIOLOGY 0F CANCER AND 0THER DISEASES [ 2 ] Cancer is characterized primari1y by an increase in the number of abnorma1. ce1ls derived from a given normal tissue , invasion of adjacent tissues by these abnormal cells , or 1ymphatic or blood - borne spread of ma1ignant cel1s to regiona1 1ymph nodes and to distant sites ( metastasis ) . C1inical data and mo1ecular bio1ogic studies indicate that cancer is a multistep process that begins with minor preneop1astic changes , which may under certain conditions progress to neoplasia. The neop1astic lesion may evo1ve clona1ly and deve1op an increasing capacity for invasion , growth , metastasis , and heterogeneity , especially under conditions in which the neop1astic ce1ls escape the hosts immune surveillance. Roitt , I. , Brostoff , J and Kale , D. , 1mmun0l0gy , 17.1 - l7.12 ( 3rd ed. , Mosby , St. Louis , Mo. , 1993 ) . [ 3 ] I There is an enormous variety of cancers which are described in detail in the medica1 11terature. Examp1es inc1udes cancer of the 1ung , colon , rectum , prostate , breast , brain , and intestine. ‘The incidence of cancer continues to climb as the genera1 population ages , as new cancers deve1op , and as susceptib1e popu1ations ( e. g. , peop1e infected with AIDS or excessively exposed to sunlight ) grow. However , options for the treatment of cancer are limited. For example , in the case of b1ood cancers ( e. g. , multip1e myeloma ) , few treatment options are avai1ab1e , especially when conventiona1 chemotherapy fails and bonemarrow transplantation is not an option. A tremendous demand therefore exists for new methods and compositions that can be used to treat patients with cancer. [ 4 ] Many types of cancers are associated with new b1ood vesse1 formation , a process known as angiogenesis. Several of the mechanisms involved in tumor - induced angiogenesis have been e1ucidated. The most direct of these mechanisms is the secretion by the turnor ce1ls of cytokines with angiogenic properties. Examples of these cytokines inc1ude acidic and basic ﬁbroblastic growth factor ( a , b - FGF ) , angiogenin , vascu1ar endothe1ial growth factor ( V EGF ) , and TNF - ot. A1ternatively , tumor ce1ls can release angiogenic peptides through the production of proteases and the subsequent breakdown of. the extracel1ular matrix where some cytokines are stored ( e. g. , b - FGF ) . Angiogenesis can. WO 2009 / 139880 PCT / US2009 / 002980 also be induced indirect1y through the recruitment of inﬂammatory ce11s ( particular1y. macrophages ) and their subsequent release of angiogenic cytokines ( e. g. , TNF - ot , b - FGF ) . [ 5 ] A variety of other diseases and disorders are a1so associated with , or characterized by , undesired angiogenesis. For example , enhanced or unregu1ated. angio genesis has been imp1icated in a number of diseases and medical conditions inc1uding , but not limited to , ocu1ar neovascu1ar diseases , choroidal neovascular diseases , retina neovascular diseases , rubeosis ( neovascu1arization of the ang1e ) , vira1 diseases , genetic diseases , inﬂammatory diseases , al1ergic diseases , and autoimmune diseases. Examp1es of such diseases and conditions include , but are not 1imited to : diabetic retinopathy ; retinopathy of prematurity ; corneal graft rejection ; neovascu1ar glaucoma ; retro1enta1 ﬁbrop1asia ; arthritis ; and pro1iferative vitreoretinopathy. [ 6 ] Accordingly , compounds that can control angiogenesis or inhibit the production of certain cytokines , inc1uding TNFa , may be useful in the treatment and. prevention of various diseases and conditions. 2.2 METHODS OF TREATING CANCER [ 7 ] Current cancer therapy may involve surgery , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy and / or radiation treatment to eradicate neoplastic ce1ls in a patient ( See , e. g. , ' Stockdale , 1998 , Medicine , vol. 3 , Rubenstein and F ederman , eds. , Chapter 12 , Section IV ) . Recent1y , cancer therapy cou1d a1so involve biologica1 therapy or immunotherapy. A11 of ‘these approaches pose signiﬁcant drawbacks for the patient. Surgery , for examp1e , may be contraindicated due to the health of a patient or may be unacceptab1e to the patient. Additionally , surgery may not comp1ete1y remove neoplastic tissue. Radiation therapy is on1y effective when the neoplastic tissue exhibits a higher sensitivity to radiation than normal tissue. Radiation therapy can also often elicit serious side effects. Hormonal therapy is rarely given as a sing1e agent. Although hormona1 therapy can be effective , it is often used to prevent or delay recurrence of cancer after other treatments have removed the majority of cancer cells. Biologica1 therapies and immunotherapies are 1imited in number and may produce side effects such as rashes or swe11ings , ﬂu - 1ike symptoms , including fever , chi1ls and fatigue , digestive tract problems or a11ergic reactions. [ 8 ] With respect to chemotherapy , there are a variety of chemotherapeutic agents avai1able for treatment of cancer. A majority of cancer chemotherapeutics act by inhibiting DNA synthesis , either directly , or indirectly by inhibiting the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate precursors , to prevent DNA replication and concomitant. cell division. Gilman et al. , Goodman and Gilmans : The Pharmac0l0gical Basis 0f. Therapeutics , Tenth Ed. ( McGraw Hill , New York ) . LAI - 302lS90vl 2. WO 2009 / 139880 PCT / US2009 / 002980 [ 9 ] Despite avai1abi1ity of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents , chemotherapy. has many drawbacks. Stockdale , Medicine , vo1. 3 , Rubenstein and Federman , eds. , ch. 12 , sect. 10 , 1998. A1most al1 chemotherapeutic agents are toxic , and chemotherapy causes signiﬁcant , and often dangerous side effects inc1uding severe nausea , bone marrow depression , and immunosuppression. Additionally , even with administration of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents , many tumor cel1s are resistant or develop resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents. In fact , those ce11s resistant to the particular chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment protoco1 often prove to be resistant to other drugs , even if those agents act by different mechanism from those of the drugs used in the speciﬁc treatment. This phenomenon is referred to as p1eiotropic drug or mu1tidrug resistance. Because of the drug resistance , many cancers prove 0r become refractory to standard chemotherapeutic treatment protoco1s. [ 10 ] Other diseases or conditions associated with , or characterized by , undesired angiogenesis are a1so difﬁcu1t to treat. However , some compounds such as protamine , hepain and steroids have been proposed to be usefu1 in the treatment of certain speciﬁc diseases. Taylor et al. , Nature 297 : 307 ( 1982 ) ; Folkman et al. , Scienee 221 : 719 ( 1983 ) ; and U. S. Pat. Nos. 5 , 001 , 116 and 4 , 994 , 443. [ l1 ] Stil1 , there is a signiﬁcant need for safe and effective methods of treating , preventing and managing cancer and other diseases and conditions , inc1uding for diseases that are refractory to standard treatments , such as surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormonal therapy , whi1e reducing or avoiding the toxicities and / or side effects. associated with the conventiona1 therapies. 3.

WO 2009 / 139880 PCT / US2009 / 002980 [ 188 ] Cel1s are plated in 96 - wel1 plates at 6000 cel1s per wel1 in media. The cells. are pre - treated with compounds at about 100 , 10 , 1 , 0.1 , 0.01 , 0.001 , 0.0001 and 0 M in a ﬁnal concentration of about 0.25 % DMSO in triplicate at - 37°C in a humidiﬁed incubator at 5 % CO2 for 72 hours. One microcurie of 3H - - thymidine ( Amersham ) is then added to each well , and cel1s are incubated again at 37C in a humidiﬁed ' incubator at 5 % CO2 for 6 hours. The cel1s are harvested onto UniFilter GF / C ﬁlter p1ates ( Perkin Elmer ) using a ce1l harvester ( Tomtec ) , and the plates are allowed to dry oVernight. Microscint 20 ( Packard ) ( 25 y1 / well ) is added , and plates are analyzed in TopCount NXT ( Packard ) . Each well is counted for one minute. Percent inhibition of ce1l proliferation is calculated by averaging al1 triplicates and normalizing to the DMSO control ( 0 % inhibition ) . Each compound is tested in each cell line in three separate experiments. Final IC5os are calculated using non - 1inear regression , sigmoida1 dose - response , constraining the top to 100 % and bottom to 0 % , allowing variab1e slope.
