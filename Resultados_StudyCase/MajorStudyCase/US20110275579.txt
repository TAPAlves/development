[ 0001 ] The present inVention re1ates to a p1ant eXtract for use as a hypog1ycemic agent , i. e. for 10Wering b1ood g1ucose 1eVe1s in mammals that are pre - diabetic or haVe type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) 0r type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. [ 0002 ] The non - communicab1e disease , diabetes mellitus , can be diVided into tWo major types , Viz. type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) and type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . T1D is Characterized by [ 3 - ce11 autoimmunity. In T2D , the pancreatic B - ce11s produce insufﬁcient insu1in , and the periphera1 tissues ( 1iVer , musc1e and adipose tissue ) are “resistant” to actions of insu1in , i. e. g1ucose uptake is inefﬁcient in these target tissues. The [ 3 - ce1ls are also often destroyed in late stages of T2D making the patient dependant on insu1in treatment. In diabetes patients , approXimate1y 5 - 10% are type 1 and 90 - 95% are type 2 diabetic. Major diabetic comp1ications inc1ude retinopathy , cerebroVascu1ar disease , coronary heart disease , neuropathy , periphera1 Vascu1ar disease , ulceration and amputation. Thus diabetes affects seVeral organs and tissues tbroughout the b0dy. Factors that contribute to the deVe1opment of diabetes inc1ude ethnicity ( Where certain popu1ation groups haVe an increased incidence of T2D , particu1ar1y if they haVe migrated ) , obesity , 8 high fat diet , the intrauterine enVironment , insu1in resistance and speciﬁc candidate genes. [ 0003 ] The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing WorldWide. A1though genetic factors may play a role , lifestyle changes such as the adoption of a Western diet , high in fat , 1eads to obesity Which can be a factor als0 contributing to the increase of this disease. Life - sty1e factors , such as increased fat intake and reduced exercise , haVe been shoWn to be associated With obesity and insulin resistance ( Lipman et al. , 1972 ; LoVejoy and DiGiro1amo , 1992 ) . In rats , high fat feeding induces a state of insu1in resistance associated With diminished insu1in - stimu1ated g1yco1ysis and g1ycogen synthesis ( Kim et a1. , 2000 ) . This disease is a resu1t 0f the peripheral insulin - responsiVe tissues , such as musc1e and adipose tissue , disp1aying a signiﬁcant decrease in response to insu1in resu1ting in an increase in circu1ating g1ucose and fatty acids in the b1ood. The 10W response to insu1in resu1ts in a decrease in g1yco1ysis Which in turn initiates g1uconeogenesis and g1ycogeno1ysis in the 1iVer , both of Which are “sWitched off” by insu1in under norma1 conditions. Pancreatic B - ce11s are ab1e to cope With the initia1 insu1in resistant phase by producing an eXcess of insulin and increasing the amount of insulin secreted ( Piro1 et a1. , 2004 ) . The resu1ting hyperinsu1inaemia to maintain normog1ycaemia eVentua1ly brings about cell dysfunction ( Khan , 2003 ) 1eading to 0Vert diabetes. It is eVident that type 2 diabetes is dependent on insu1ts occurring both at periphera1 as We11 as the ce1lu1ar 1eVe1 ( Khan et al. , 2000 ) . [ 0004 ] It is We11 estab1ished that insu1in resistance and subsequent B - ce11 fai1ure are major fact0rs inﬂuencing the progression from norma1 g1ucose to1erance , tbrough impaired g1ucose to1erance , to T2D. Lifesty1e changes associated With the moVe from a rura1 to an urban area 1ead to an increase in obesity in urban b1ack South Africans and this is associated With insu1in resistance , Which is an0ther feature of T2D. To compensate for the insu1in resistant state , [ 3 - ce11s produce. N0V. 10 , 2011. more insu1in and this 1eads to a higher demand on the already oVerWorked B - ce11s Which Wi11 resu1t in B - ce11 eXhaustion and u1timate1y B - ce11fai1ure. [ 0005 ] There Were an estimated 30M pe0p1e With diabetes in the Wor1d in 1985. By 1995 the number had increased to 135M. The 1atest Wor1d Hea1th Organization ( WHO ) estimate is that 30OM pe0p1e Wi11 haVe diabetes in 2025 , an increase 0f 122%. This is in agreement With the Internationa1 Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) estimation , in 2025 , of 333M peop1e With diabetes ( 6.3% preVa1ence ) , Wbi1e 472M Wil1 be diagnosed With impaired glucose to1erance ( IGT ; 9% preVa - 1ence ) . There Wi11 be an estimated increase of 42% from 51 M to 72M , for the deVe1oped W0r1d ( Where there is an increase in the incidence of oVerWeight and obese indiVidua1s , increasing their risk for becoming diabetic ) and an increase of 170% from 84M to 228M for deVeloping countries ( due to a myriad of factors inc1uding dietary changes , increased physica1 actiVity and rapid urbanizati0n ) . Thus While diabetes Was preVious1y considered a Western 11fe sty1e disease affecting peop1e in the deVeloped countries , current trends suggest that by 2025 oVer 75% of al1 peop1e With diabetes Will be in the deVeloping Wor1d. Another contributing factor to the increased incidence of diabetes in the deVe10ping Wor1d is deVe1opmenta1 programming. In many parts of the deVe1oping Wor1d , peop1e are often eXposed to a poor diet ( undemutrition ) in utero fol1oWed by oVemutrition postnata1ly Which has been shoWn to predispose indiVidua1s to deVe1oping T2D. Furthermore , a tota1 of 1.1 bi11ion peop1e are current1y oVerWeight , and 320M pe0p1e are obese ( IDF ) . This emphasizes the huge g1obal economic burden of obesity , and as obesity is a major risk factor for deVeloping diabetes , this may potentially ﬁ1rther exacerbate the already huge economic burden associated With diabetes. [ 0006 ] ConserVatiVe estimates for South Africa , based on minima1 data , predict an increase from 5.6M in 2000 to oVer 8M in 2010. The 18rgest increase is most 1ike1y to be in the b1ack popu1ations due to urbanisation , since this is accompanied by 1ifesty1e and dietary changes from a 10W fat to a bigh fat diet. Figures in 1998 shoWed urban b1ack South Africans to haVe an esca1ating incidence of T2D With the age - adjusted preVa1ence approaching 8% ( LeVitt , 1993 ) , almost doub1e the ﬁgure of 4.2% published in 1974 ( Joffe & Sefte1 ) . In 1996 data for the top tWenty causes of deaths in South Africa ( BradshaW et a1 , 1996 ) reVea1ed diabetes to be the 10m in ma1es and 77 in fema1es. HoWeVer , comp1ications of diabetes , such as ischaemic heart disease and other cardioVascu1ar and kidney complications contribute signiﬁcant1y to the number of deaths and adjusted ﬁgures cou1d p1ace diabetes in the top tbree 0r four causes of death in SouthAfrica. The incidence of T2D is greater than HIV in SA , thus T2D Warrants nationa1 attention. [ 0007 ] Diabetes is an eXpensiVe disease and , although information on the cost of treating diabetics in SouthAfrica is not aVai1ab1e , there are many indirect c0sts. These include a reduction in the qua1ity of 11fe , the abi1ity to contribute to the community and the Workforce and its effect on the economy. This is eXacerbated by an increased cost to Medica1 Aid Schemes resu1ting in increased Medica1 Aid premiums. Diabetes also affects the economy direct1y. In the absence of diabetes re1ated ﬁnancia1 data in South Africa , pub1ished data from the UK shoW that With more than 1.5M adu1ts in the UK current1y diagnosed With diabetes and its comp1ications , the tota1Nationa1 Hea1th SerVice ( NHS ) cost is £52 bil1i0n each year , Wbich is 9% 0f the t0ta1 NHS budget. In the USA , the. US 20l l / 0275579 Al. estimated direct costs are US$ 44 billion and , With loss of productiVity , this ﬁgure increased to US$ 98 bi1lion. Similar ﬁgures are aVailable for many 01her c0untries. [ 0008 ] T2D is diagnosed by raised leVels of plasma glucose. HoWeVer , our preVious research has sh0Wn that by the time blo0d g1uc0se leVels increase , seri0us damage has already occu1red in the cardioVascular system and the pancreas. FolloWing diagnosis of diabetes by raised blood glucose leVels , therapies such as diet and exercise and / or aVailable medication can result in a temporary impr0Vement in plasma glucose leVels but cannot halt the progression of the disease. The rate of failure of these therapies is associated With the rate of continuing B - cell decline. Current treatment inV0lVes insulin injection or stimulating insulin release and / or action by medication. [ 0009 ] There are many theories for explaining the impairment of insulin production by the pancreas that leads to the diabetic condition. Reference is made to tWo papers : “Mechanisms of pancreatic beta - cell destruction in type I diabetes” by Nerup J , Mandrup - Poulsen T , MolVig J , Hequist S , Wogensen L , Egeberg J. published in Diabetes Care. 1988 ; 11 Suppl 1 : 16 - 23 ; and the second entitled “Autoimmune Imbalance and Double NegatiVe T Cel1s Associated With Resistant , Prone and Diabetic Animals” , Hosszufalusi , N. , Chan , E. , Granger , G. , and Charles , M. ; J Autoimmun , 5 : 305 - 18 ( 1992 ) . These papers shoW that inﬁammation of the pancreatic islets interrupts insulin production. Speciﬁcally , the insulin pr0ducing [ 3 - cells in the pancreatic islets are destroyed by immune attack. Such [ 5 - ce1l destruction is recognized as being due to attack by seVeral types of immune cells including NK ( natural killer ) cells and double negatiVe T - Lymphocytes. [ 0010 ] Diabetes is considered to be insidi0us , since there is no knoWn cure. Various treatments , hoWeVer , haVe been used to ameliorate diabetes. For example , dietetic measures haVe been employed to balance the relatiVe amounts of proteins , fats , and carb0hydrates in a patient. Diabetes educati0n and aWareness programmes haVe als0 been implemented in seVeral countries. In addition , diabetic c0nditions of moderate or seVere intensity are treated by the administration of insulin. Also , prescription drugs such as “G1ucoside” haVe been employed to rejuVenate impaired insu1in production in adult onset diabetics. Other drugs are used to modulate the effectiVeness of insulin. In any case , treatment of either juVenile or adult onset diabetes , has achieVed only partial success. This is due to most agents targeting either improVed beta - cell function 0r reducing insulin resistance , With the effect attenuating as the disease progressiVely Worsens. Thus patients require the use ( often daily ) of a combination of agents to control the disease. [ 0011 ] Biguanides , such as metformin , became aVailable for treatment of type 2 diabetes in the late 1950s , and haVe been effectiVe hypoglycaemic agents eVer since Wigneri and Goldﬁne , 1987 ) . Little is knoWn about the exact molecular mechanism of these agents. As an insulin sensitizer , metformin acts predominantly on the 11Ver , Where it suppresses glucose release ( Goldﬁne , 200l ) . Metformin has also been shoWn to inhibit the enzymatic actiVity of complex I of the respiratory chain and thereby impairs both mitochondrial function and cell respiration , and in so doing decreasing the ATP / ADP ratio Which actiVates AMP actiVated protein kinases causing catabolic responses on the short term and insulin sensitization on the long term ( Brunmair et al. , 2004 ; Tiikkainen et al. , 2004 ) . This drug has been proVen effective in both mon0therapy and in combination With sulfonylureas. N0V. lO , 20ll. or insulin ( DaVidson and Peters , 1997 ) . Diabetes in the young is a global phenomenon that is increasing in incidence. Some key transcription factors , important for beta - cell deVelopment , differentiation and function , are implicated in diabetes in the young. Some of these are direct targets of current therapeutic agents. The cost of current diabetic drugs is Very high and the deVelopment of more affordable altematiVe therapies Would be an adVantage. The global burden of T2D is huge. Strategic action is required to endure affordable diabetes treatment to improVe the quality of life of tho se indiViduals affected. This is particularly true for the deVeloping World. It is for this reason that scientists are inVestigating the efﬁcacy of indigenous plant extracts in their oWn country. [ 0012 ] Rooibos , ( scientiﬁc name AspaZaﬂaus Zinearis ) is a member of the legume fami1y of plants and is used to make a tisane ( herbal tea ) . Aspalathus [ inearis is a unique SouthAfrican fynbos plant cultiVated for the production of Rooibos tea. Rooibos tea is made from the stalks and leaVes of the plant , Which are shredded , bruised and moistened , folloWed by a long period of 0pen air oxidation ( “fermentation” ) and sun - drying to alloW f0r deVelopment of the characteristic Rooibos colour and ﬂaVour. Processed plant material is then sieVed and packaged as loose leaVes or in tea bags. This processed material is referred to as “fermented Rooibos tea”. “Green” Ro0ibos tea refers to the unoxidised ( “unfermented” ) Rooibos plant material that is processed in such a manner as to preVent or limit oxidatiVe changes. [ 0013 ] Health - pr0moting properties associated With R0oibos tea include relief of insomnia , nerVous tension , st0mach cramps and allergic symptoms. FlaVonoids in Rooibos tea haVe strong antioxidant and free radical scaVenging actiVities and haVe the potential to act as anti - carcinogenic and antiarteriosclerotic agents. Ro0ib0s tea and products deriVed therefrom are Valuable for use in food / nutraceutical , pha1maceutical and / or cosmetic industry. [ 0014 ] At present , Type 1 diabetic patients are treated With insulin , While the majority of Type 2 diabetic patients are treated With hypoglycemic agents , such as sulfonylureas that stimulate [ 3 - ce1l function , With other agents that enhance the tissue se1ectiVity of the patients toWards insulin , or With insu - 1in itself. Unfortunately , the use of insulin currently requires multiple dai1y doses , n0rmally administered by self - inj ection , With determination of the proper dosage of insulin requiring frequent estimations of the sugar in urine or blood , performed either by the patient or the administering physician. The unintended administration 0f an excess dose of insulin can result in hyp0glycemia , With adVerse effects ranging from mild abno1malities in blood glucose to coma , or eVen death. Although hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas haVe been empl0yed Widely in the treatment of NIDDM , this treatment is , in many instances , not c0mpletely satisfactory. Where existing treatments proVe ineffectiVe in normalizing blood sugar leVels of patients , there is an increased risk of acquiring diabetic complications. Also , many patients gradually lose the ability to respond to treatment With sulfonylureas and are thus gradual1y forced into insulin treatment. Since many extant forms of diabetic therapy haVe proVen ineffectiVe achieVing satisfactory glycemic control , there continues to be a great demand for noVel therapeutic approaches. [ 0015 ] As a result of its adipogenic effect , insulin has the undesirable effect of promoting obesity in patients With type 2 diabetes. ( See , Moller , D. E. ( 2001 ) Nature 414 : 821 - 827 ) . Unfortunately , other anti - diabetic drugs , including metformin , Which are currently being used to stimulate glucose. US 20l l / 0275579 Al. transport in patients With type 2 diabetes also possess adipogenic actiVity. Thus While current drug therapy may proVide reduction in blood sugar , it often promotes 0besity. Acc0rdingly , neW compositions and methods for treating hyperglycemia are desirable. Compositions that stimulate glucose uptake Without generating concomitant adipogenic side effects are especially desirable. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION.

The anti - diabetic agent may be an extract from rooibos ( Aspalarhus spp. ) , aspalathin as such or in combination With rutin. [ 0017 ] The treatment of the present inVention Was discoVered because the inVentors found that a steam or aqueous extract of rooibos ( Aspalathus ssp ) Was effectiVe in contr0l - 11ng blood sugar. For the medica1 use in accordance With the present inVention the plant is gathered , dried , and combined With a solVent such as Water and / or an alcoho1 , preferably ethanol. [ 0018 ] It has surprisingly been found that the plant extract of the present inVention exhibit a superior antidiabetic effect When administered in an amount from about I milligram to about 5 milligrams , preferably to about 2.5 milligrams , per kilogram body Weight. [ 0019 ] Accordingly , in a ﬁrst aspect the present inVention relates to an anti - diabetic composition comprising an aqueous extract of plants 0f the genus Aspalathus , preferably Aspalathus [ inear / ‘s , said compositi0n administered in a dose range of 1 - 5 mg / kg , preferably to about 2.5 mg / kg , body Weight. [ 0020 ] In another aspect of the inVention there is proVided a method for isolating a therapeutic extract of the p1ant Asp / 11 - athus With anti - diabetic effects , said method comprising the steps of : . [ 0021 ] ( a ) proViding Aspalathus plants or portions thereof , [ 0022 ] ( b ) combining said plants or portions thereof With a nontoxic solVent , such as Water and / or an alcohol , preferably ethanol , appropriate for solubilizing said plant extract , [ 0023 ] ( c ) recoVering said plant extract , and. [ 0024 ] ( d ) optionally drying. [ 0025 ] The present inVentors haVe found that administering an extract of the plant genus Aspalathus alloWs for treatment of diabetes , and in particular of early stages of diabetes , also referred to as pre - diabetic states. [ 0026 ] Thus , the present inVention relates to comp0sitions deriVed from the plant genus Aspalathus and methods for treating subjects Who are hyperglycemic , particularly subjects With Type 2 diabetes as Well as diabetic subjects Who are oVerWeight. In a preferred embodiment the present inVention proVides a AspaIathL / s plant extract for treating subjects Who are hyperglycemic. N0V. lO , 20ll. [ 0027 ] The present inVention also proVides a method for reducing bl0od glucose leVels in subjects Who are hyperglycemic. The method comprises administering the Aspalathus plant extract to the hyperglycemic subject. Although it is possible to administer the extract to the subject by injection , the preferred method of administration inVolVes oral administration. The method is useful for treating subjects Wh0 are hyperglycemic , as Well as subjects With diabetes mellitus. The method is especially useful for treating oVerWeight subjects With Type 2 diabetes , and in particular early stages thereof. [ 0028 ] The present inVentors haVe also found that the extracts of the inVention increase the actiVity 0f Glut4 and Glu2 in an independent manner so that in some instances both of these glucose transporters are more actiVe Whereas in other instances 0nly one of them are actiVe. Accordingly , the present inVention also proVides a method of controlling diabetes mel1itus in a mamma1 comprising the step of administering to the mammal an extract of Aspalathus in an amount that increases the actiVity of Glut4 and / or Glut2. [ 0029 ] As a consequence thereof the present inVention is also useful for screening actiVe ingredients of the extracts. Thus , the present inVention furthermore proVides a method of screening speciﬁc compounds of the extract for anti - diabetic actiVity in a mammal comprising the step of determining Which compounds that increase the actiVity of Glut4 and / or Glut2. [ 003 0 ] The treatment of the present inVention Was discoVered because the inVentors found that a steam or aqueous extract of Aspalathus Was effectiVe in controlling blood sugar. For use the plant is gathered , dried , and combined With boiling Water. The extract is then taken 0rally by a patient on a periodic basis. Aspalathus is knoWn to be rich in ﬂaV0noids and other secondary plant products. The extracts as Well as the pure actiVe components herein described haVe been administered to both diabetic rats and monkeys ; the results clearly and unambiguously shoW that such extracts Wil1haVe a signiﬁcant impact on the future treatment of diabetes in humans. [ 0031 ] Speciﬁc ﬁaVonoids haVe been extracted and fractionated from Aspalathus and administered to diabetic rats With resu1ts similar to those produced by the extract. The flaV0noids speciﬁca1ly used Were aspalathin and rutin. It Was then discoVered that these ﬂaVon0ids are most effectiVe in combination. What Was truly surprising Was the discoVery that aspalathin alone or in combination With rutin , in particu - 1ar , is effectiVe in loWering the bl0od sugar and generally alleViating diabetic symptoms in both T1 D and T2D rats. This result Was unexpected because conVentional Wisdom teaches that these tWo fo1ms of diabetes haVe basically different causes ( [ 3 - cell destruction and insulin resistance in muscles respectiVe1y ) .

[ 0047 ] The folloWing descripti0n is proVided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the inVention and sets forth the best modes contemplated by the inVentors of carrying out their inVention. Various modiﬁcations , hoWeVer , Will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art , since the general principles of the present inVention haVe been deﬁned herein speciﬁcally to proVide treatment 0f both insulin - dependent and non - insulin dependent diabetes tbrough the administration of ﬂaVonoids particularly tbrough the administration of a plant extract in accordance With the present inVenti0n. [ 0048 ] Deﬁnitions. [ 0049 ] The term “diabetes mellitus” or “diabetes” means a disease or condition that is generally characterized by metabolic defects in production and utilization of glucose Which result in the failure to maintain appropriate blo0d sugar leVels in the body. The result 0f these defects is eleVated b1ood glucose , referred to as “hyperglycemia.” TWo major forms of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. As described aboVe , Type 1 diabetes is generally the result of an absolute deﬁciency 0f insu1in , the hormone Wbich regulates glucose utilization. Type 2 diabetes often 0ccurs in the face of norma1 , or eVen eleVated leVels of insulin and can result from the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Most Type 2 diabetic patients are insulin resistant and haVe a relatiVe deﬁciency of insulin , in that insulin secretion can not compensate for the resistance of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin. In addition , many Type 2 diabetics are obese. Other types of disorders of glucose homeostasis include impaired glucose to1erance , Which is a metabolic stage intermediate betWeen normal glucose home0stasis and diabetes. The guidelines for diagnosis for Type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance haVe been outlined by the American Diabetes Association ( see , e. g. , The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation of Diabetes Mellitus , Diabetes Care , ( 1999 ) Vol 2 ( Supp1 1 ) : SS - 19 ) . [ 0050 ] The term “symptom” of diabetes , includes , but is not limited to , polyuria , polydipsia , and polyphagia , hyperinsulinemia , and hyperglycemia as used herein , inc0rporating their common usage. For example , “polyuria” means the passage of a large Volume of urine during a giVen period ; “p0lydipsia” means cbronic , excessiVe thirst ; “polyphagia” means excessiVe eating , and hyperinsulinemia means eleVated blood leVels of insulin. Other symptoms of diabetes include , for example , increased susceptibility to certain infections ( especially fungal and staphyl0c0ccal infections ) , nausea , and ketoacidosis ( enhanced production of ketone bodies in the blood ) . [ 0051 ] Dosage. [ 0052 ] The r0oibos ( Aspalathus ssp. ) plant extract is administered to the subject in a therapeutically effectiVe amount. As used herein , the term “therapeutically effectiVe amount” means the total amount that is suiﬁcient to shoW a meaningful beneﬁt , i. e. , a reduction in the subjects blood glucose leVels. The d0sages of the plant extract needed to obtain a meaningful resu1t , can be determined in VieW of this. US 20l l / 0275579 Al. disclosure by one of ordinary skill in the art by running routine trials With appr0priate contro1s. Comparison of the appropriate treatment groups to the contr0ls Wi1l indicate Whether a particular dosage is effectiVe at reducing the subjects blood glucose leVels. When orally administered the extract should be in doses of at least O.1 mg / kg body Weight , preferably at least 1 mg / kg , more preferably at least 2.5 mg / kg , eVen more preferably at least 5 mg / kg , most preferably at least 25 mg / kg , such as at least 50 mg / kg , at least 75 mg / kg , at least lO0 mg / kg , at least 250 mg / kg , and at least 500 mg / kg. [ 0053 ] The amount of the plant extract required Will depend upon the nature and seVerity of the condition being treated , and on the nature of prior treatments Which the subject has undergone. Ultimately , the dosage Will be determined using clinical trials. Initially , the clinician Will administer doses that haVe been deriVed from animal studies. An effectiVe amount can be achieVed by one administration of the composition. AltematiVely , an effectiVe amount is achieVed by multiple administration of the composition to the subject. [ 0054 ] In Vitro , the biological1y effectiVe am0unt , i. e. , the amount sufﬁcient to induce gluc0se uptake , is administered in tWo - fold increments , to determine the full range of actiVity. The efﬁcacy of oral , subcutaneous and intraVenous administration is determined in clinical studies. Although a single administration of the extract may be beneﬁcial , it is expected that multiple doses Will be preferred. [ 0055 ] DeliVery. [ 0056 ] Administration of the rooibos plant extract preferably is by oral administration. Although less preferred , the extract may also be administered by injection. Formulations of the present inVention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules , cachets , tab - 1ets , boluses or lozenges , each containing a predetermined amount of the actiVe compound ; as a poWder or granules ; or in liquid form , e. g. , as an aqueous solution , suspension , syrup , elixir , emulsion , dispersion , or the 1ike. The extract may be administered in the form of pills ( poWder or concentrated 11quid in capsules ) , 0r poWder form ( e. g. dried poWder but pressed into grains ) that can be consumed after putting into Water ( simi1ar to drinking tea or coffee ) . [ 0057 ] Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conVeniently comprise a sterile preparation of the actiVe compound in , for example , Water for injection , saline , 8 polyethylene glycol solution and the like , Which is preferably isotonic With the blood of the recipient. Useful formulations also comprise concentrated solutions or solids containing the rooibos plant extract Which upon dilution With an appropriate solVent giVe a solution suitable for parenteral administration. [ 0058 ] In addition to the aforementioned ingredients , the formulations of this inVention may further include one or more optional accessory ingredient ( s ) utilized in the art of pharmaceuticalformulations , i. e. , diluents , buffers , ﬂaVoring agents , col0rants , binders , surface actiVe agents , thickeners , lubricants , suspending agents , preserVatiVes ( including antioxidants ) and the like. [ 0059 ] The amount of the rooibos plant extract required to be effectiVe f0r any indicated condition Will , of course , Vary With the indiVidual mammal being treated and is ultimately at the discretion of the medica1 or Veterinary practitioner. The factors to be considered include the condition being treated , the route of administration , the nature of the formulation , the mammals body Weight , surface area , age and general condition , and the particular extract t0 be administered. The total. N0V. lO , 20ll. daily dose may be giVen as a single dose , multiple doses , e. g. , tWo to six times per day , or by intraVenous infusion for a selected duration. Dosages ab0Ve or beloW the range cited aboVe are Within the scope of the present inVenti0n and may be administered to the indiVidual patient if desired and necessary. [ 0060 ] The composition comprises a biol0gically effectiVe amount of the rooibos plant extract , and , optionally , a relatiVely inert carrier. Many such carriers are routinely used and can be identiﬁed by reference t0 pharmaceutical texts. The acceptable carrier is a physiologically acceptable diluent or adj uVant. The term physiologically acceptable means a nontoxic material that does not interfere With the effectiVeness of the analog. The characteristics of the carrier Will depend on the route of administration and particular compound or combination of compounds in the composition. Preparation of such formu1ations is Within the leVel of skill in the art. The composition may further contain other agents that either enhance the actiVity of the analog or complement its actiVity. The composition may further comprise ﬁllers , salts , buffers , stabilizers , solubilizers , and other materials Well knoWn in the art. [ 0061 ] Concerning the ﬂaVonoids in accordance With the present inVention the fol1oWing shou1d be mentioned. [ 0062 ] AspaZathin is a natural molecule found in rooibos. The molecule is classiﬁed as a ﬂaVonoid , one of at least four thousand knoWn ﬂaVonoids. Aspalath / ‘n is the principal monomeric polyphenol occurring in the leaVes of Aspalathus Iinearis. The chemical name of Aspalathin is 3 ' - C - ﬁ - D - glucopyranosyl - 2 ' , 3 , 4 , 4 ' , 6 ' - pentahydroxydihydrochalcone ( I ) and has the structure : . HO OH. . OH O. OH OH OH. US 20l l / 0275579 Al. [ 0064 ] Other related compounds With a backbone of 2 - phenylcbromen - 4 - one ( 2 - phenyl - l - benzopyran - 4 - one ) , so called ﬁaVones : . . [ 0065 ] are present in rooibos and all of them exert some kind of antidiabetic actiVity ( Veriﬁed in Vitro ) . [ 0066 ] Different species of rooib0s contain these , or similar ﬁaVonoids , albeit in different proportions. Experiments With diabetic test animals ( rats ) Were carried out. The rooibos extract of the present inVenti0n Was effectiVe in contro1ling blood glucose in these model systems. Further , the administrati0n of synthetic Versions of the ﬂaVon0ids Were also effectiVe at loWering g1ucose leVe1s. HoWeVer , it Was found by the present inVentors that a combination of Aspa [ athin With the other ﬂaVonoids , especially rutin , results in an enhanced ( synergistic ) effect in that blood glucose can be maximally loWered With a loWer oVerall ﬂaVonoid d0se. The effect is most pronounced When the molar concentration of aspalathin is at least tWice that of rutin. In addition thereto it Was found that the antidiabetic effect of these ﬁaVonoids is greater When present in the plant extract of the present inVention than in their pure form. [ 0067 ] According to the present inVention , and as hereinbefore and hereafter mentioned : “diabetes” preferably refers to non - insulin dependent diabetes ( type 2 ) ; “anti - diabetic” means the actiVity useful for the “treatment” of “diabetes” , Which includes the preVenti0n of the deVel0pment of diabetes , and / 01 the treatment of established diabetes ; it also includes the preVention of the causes of diabetes , and / or the decrease or disappearance of its symptoms and / or consequences. [ 0068 ] In particular , it has been found that compounds of the inVention haVe at 1east the folloWing double therapeutic effect : . [ 0069 ] i ) the preVention of diabetes , since the compounds of the inVention can treat impaired glucose tolerance ; and. [ 0070 ] ii ) the actual treatment of established diabetes since the compounds of the inVention can decrease the blood glucose leVel. [ 0071 ] Preferably , the extract of the present inVention comprises as an actiVe ingredient a compound haVing the essential features of aspalathin and / 0r a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof. More preferably the extract also comprises as an actiVe ingredient a compound haVing the essential features of rutin. Most preferably the molar concentration of aspalathin is at least tWice that of rutin. [ 0072 ] According to a further aspect , the inVention also concerns the said extract for use as a medicament haVing anti - diabetic actiVity. [ 0073 ] The inVention also extends to a pharmaceutical composition haVing anti - diabetic actiVity comprising an effectiVe quantity of the extract ; and to aspalathin and rutin haVing anti - diabetic actiVity. N0V. lO , 20ll. [ 0074 ] There is also proVided a method for treating diabetes by administering to a human or animal an effectiVe dosage of the said extract or the said comp0sition. [ 0075 ] According to a still further aspect , the inVention also concerns the use of the said extract in the manufacture of a foodstuff or beVerage to haVe an anti - diabetic effect When ingested. [ 0076 ] The said foodstuff or beVerage comprising an effectiVe quantity of the said extract to haVe an anti - diabetic effect When ingested is also part of the present inVention. [ 0077 ] Preferably , the said extract comprises as an actiVe ingredient aspalathin and / or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof. [ 0078 ] According to a further aspect , the inVention also concerns the said extract for use as a medicament haVing anti - diabetic actiVity. [ 0079 ] The inVention also extends to a pharmaceutical composition haVing anti - diabetic actiVity comprising an effectiVe quantity of the said extract ; and to aspalathin haVing anti - diabetic actiVity. [ 0080 ] The actiVe ingredient may be an extract from a plant of the genus Aspalathus , or a compound haVing the structure ( aspalathin ) : . . . HO OH \ / HO C\H2 0 OH HO OH OH C / CH2—CH2©OH 6 8 \H / . [ 0081 ] either extracted from a plant of the genus Aspalathus or prepared synthetically or a deriVatiVe thereof. [ 0082 ] The plant may be of the species Aspalathus linearis. [ 0083 ] Preferably , the compounds of the inVention are prepared in pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms. The antidiabetic composition or formu1ation may consist of the antidiabetic agent admixed With a pharmaceutical excipient , diluent or carrier. Other suitable additiVes , including a stabilizer and such other ingredients as may be desired may be added. [ 0084 ] The composition may be prepared in unit dosage form. [ 0085 ] As an anti - diabetic agent , aspa1athin , or aspalathin in combination With rutin , is adVantageously administered to a human in a dosage am0unt of from about 0.05 mg / kg / day to about 100 mg / kg / day. A preferred dosage range is about 0.1 mg / kg / day to about 50 mg / kg / day. When using the spray dried poWder form of the extract of this inVention , a preferred dosage range is ab0ut O.5 mg / kg / day to about 100 mg / kg / day ; especially preferred is about 1 mg / kg / day to about 50 mg / kg / day. Aspa1ath1 ' 71 and rutin is preferably in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 to 2 : 1. [ 0086 ] According to a further aspect , the inVention also concerns a pharmaceutical comp0sition comprising an effectiVe amount of : . US 20l l / 0275579 Al.

Other anti - diabetic agents that can be used include ergoset and D - chiroinositol. Other anti - diabetic agents Will be knoWn to those skilled in the art. [ 0090 ] Any glycogen pho sphorylase inhibitor may be used as the second compound of this inVention. The te1m glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor refers to any substance or agent or any c0mbination of substances and / or agents Which reduces , retards , or eliminates the enzymatic action 0f glyc0gen phosphorylase. The cu1rently knoWn enzymatic action of glycogen phosphorylase is the degradation of glycogen by catalysis of the reVersible reaction 0f 8 glycogen macromolecule and inorganic phosphate to glucose - I - phosphate and a glycogen macromolecu1e Which is one glucosyl residue shorter than the. N0V. lO , 20ll. original glycogen macromolecule ( forWard direction of glycogenolysis ) . Such actions are readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays ( e. g. , as described hereinafter ) . A Variety of these compounds are included in the folloWing published PCT patent applications : PCT application publication WO 96 / 3 9384 and W09 6 / 3 9385. HOWeVer , other glyc0gen phosphorylase inhibitors Will be knoWn to those skilled in the art. [ 0091 ] Any sorbitol dehydrogenase inhibitor may be used as the second compound of the inVention. Sorbito1 dehydrogenase inhibitors loWer fructose leVels and haVe been used to treat or preVent diabetic complications such as neuropathy , retinopathy , nephropathy , cardiomy0pathy , microangiopathy , and macroangiopathy. U. S. Pat. Nos. 5 , 728 , 704 and 5 , 866 , 578 disclose compounds and a method for treating or preVenting diabetic complications by inhibiting the enzyme s0rbitol dehydrogenase. [ 0092 ] A gluc0sidase inhibit0r inhibits the enzymatic hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates by glycoside hydrolases , for example amylase or maltase , into bioaVailable simple sugars , for example , glucose. The rapid metabolic action of glucosidases , particularly f0l1oWing the intake of high leVels of carbohydrates , resu1ts in a state of alimentary hyperglycemia Which , in adipose or diabetic subjects , leads to enhanced secretion of insulin , increased fat synthesis and a reduction in fat degradation. FolloWing such hyperglycemias , hypoglycemia frequently occurs , due to the augmented leVels of insu1in present. Additionally , it is knoWn that both hypoglycemias and chyme remaining in the stomach promotes the production of gastric juice , Which initiates or faVors the deVelopment of gastritis or duodenal ulcers. Accordingly , glucosidase inhibitors are knoWn to haVe uti1ity in accelerating the passage of carbohydrates thr0ugh the stomach and inhibiting the absorption 0f glucose fr0m the intestine. Furthermore , the conVersion of carbohydrates into lipids of the fatty tissue and the subsequent incorporation of alimentary fat into fatty tissue deposits is accordingly reduced or delayed , With the concomitant beneﬁt of reducing or preVenting the de1eterious abnormalities resulting therefr0m.

Still more preferably , the inVention proVides a protectiVe effect , in that the glucose b1ood leVel may not substantially increase after the arrest of the administration of an extract , compound , composition and / or foodstuff or beVerage described aboVe. [ 0131 ] The present inVention also proVides a method for extracting the actiVe ingredients from Aspa / athus / inearis. [ 0132 ] The extract haVing anti - diabetic actiVity according to the inVention may be prepared in accordance With the folloWing process. The process for preparing an extract of a p1ant of the genus Aspalathus comprising a anti - diabetic agent includes the steps of treating collected p1ant material With a solVent to extract a fraction haVing anti - diabetic actiVity , separating the extraction solution from the rest 0f the plant material , remoVing the solVent from the extraction solution and recoVering the extract. The extract so recoVered may be further puriﬁed , e. g. by Way of suitab1e solVent extraction procedures. [ 0133 ] The extract may be prepared from plant material such as the leaVes , stems and roots 0f said plants of the genus Aspalat / zus. In one application of the inVention , the antidiabetic extract is obtained from the species Aspala1hus l / ‘n - eams. [ 0134 ] The plant material may be homogenised in the presence of a suitable solVent , for example , a methanol / methylene chl0ride solVent , by means 0f a deVice such as a Waring b1ender. The extraction solution may then be separated from the residual plant material by an appropriate separation procedure such as , for example , ﬁltration or centrifugation. The solVent may be remoVed by means of a rotary eVaporator , preferably in a Water bath at a temperature of 600 C. [ 0135 ] The separated crude extract may then be further extracted With methylene chloride and Water before being separated into a methylene chloride extract and a Water extract. The methylene ch1oride extract may haVe the solVent remoVed preferably by means of eVaporation on a rotary eVaporator and the resultant extract may be further puriﬁed by Way of a methanol / hexane extraction. The methanol / hexane extraction product may then be separated to yield a methanol. N0V. lO , 201l. extract and a hexane extract. The methano1 extract may be eVaporated to remoVe the solVent in order to yield a partially puriﬁed actiVe extract. [ 0136 ] The partially puriﬁed actiVe extract may be dissolVed in methanol , and may be further fractionated by column chromatography , employing silica gel as an adsorption medium and a chloroform / 30% methanol mixture as an eluent. A plurality of different fractions may be obtained , and each may be eValuated , by suitable bioassaying procedures , to determine the anti - diabetic actiVity thereof. [ 0137 ] A fraction haVing anti - diabetic actiVity may preferably be further fractionated such as by column chromatography using silica gel as an adsorption medium and a 9 : 1 chloroform : methan0l solVent , and the resultant sub - fractions bioassayed f0r their anti - diabetic actiVity. A sub - fraction displaying anti - diabetic actiVity may , if desired , be further fractionated and puriﬁed , conVeniently using a column chromatographic procedure With silica gel as the adsorption medium and a 9 : 1 ethylacetate : hexane solVent. The resultant puriﬁed fractions may again be eValuated by suitable bioassay procedures for their anti - diabetic actiVity. [ 0138 ] The inVentors haVe found that at least one such puriﬁed fraction has good anti - diabetic actiVity , and the actiVe principle in the fraction Was identiﬁed by conVentional chemical techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance , and Was found to be aspalathin. [ 0139 ] The extract may be dried to remoVe moisture , e. g. by spray - drying , freeze - drying or Vacuum drying , to form a free - ﬁoWing poWder. [ 0140 ] The inVention and its efﬁcacy is further described , Without limitation of the scope of the inVention With the folloWing examp1es and draWings. [ 0141 ] Experimental [ 0142 ] ExperimentI. [ 0143 ] Plant Extract ( Laborat0ry Scale ) . [ 0144 ] Green plant material refers to plant material that is dried in such a manner to preVent enzymatic / chemical oxidation of the plant polyphenols and in particular the ﬁaVonoids. Different drying procedures can be used. [ 0145 ] Oxidised plant material refers to plant material that is oxidised for seVeral hours after cutting of leaVes and stems. The latter process initiates enzymatic and chemical oxidation of the polyphenols , in particular the ﬁaVonoids. A Water / enzyme ( s ) mixture can be added to aid enzymatic / chemical changes that takes place during the oxidation step of processing. [ 0146 ] In the beloW examples the plant extract used haVe been obtained by the folloWing procedure. [ 0147 ] The preparation procedure inVolVed steeping lO0 g of mil1ed plant material / Aspa / athus / inearis leaVes ( 1 mm sieVe ) in 1000 mL freshly boiled deionised Water for 5 minutes. Extracts Were then c0arse ﬁltered With a Buchner ﬁlter , using a 125 um synthetic mesh cloth ( Polymer PES D25 / 35 supplied by SWiss Silk Bolting Cloth Mfg. Co. Ltd , Zurich , SWitzerland ) , folloWed by ﬁltration With Whatman No. 4 ﬁlter paper ( Whatman International Ltd. , Maidstone , England ) t0 remoVe ﬁner particles. The ﬁltrates Were freezedried in an Atlas pilot - scale freeze - drier ( Denmark model , Copenhagen , Denmark , 400 C. shelf temperature ) after being frozen at - 200 C. in plastic trays ( 170xl15x30 mm ) . The freeze - dried aque0us extracts Were placed in clear glass Vials and st0red in desiccators under Vacuum in the dark. US 20l1 / 0275579 Al. [ 0148 ] 1. Tissue Culture : in Vitro Assay Models ( Cell Lines ) for Anti Diabetic Screening. [ 0149 ] Diabetes is a multi factorial disease that affects many organs differently. Therefore , a combination of three ce1l lines , each representing a different organ affected by diabetes , plus a unique but simple , non - radi0actiVe method , are used to measure glucose utilization , instead of glucose transport. [ 0150 ] Method. [ 0151 ] The method measures the utilisation of glucose by 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , Chang liVer cells and C2C12 my0cytes in 96 - Well plates , oVer a period of one to three hours , depending on the ce1l line. This is done by starVing the cells , adding glucose and then monitoring the disappearance of glucose from the incubation medium in the presence and absence of test samples. The adipocytes and liVer cells are pre - exposedto the test samples for 48 hours , pri0r to the measurement of glucose uti1ization , to ensure that any chronic effects are also considered. Viability of cells exposed to the extracts for 48 hours is compared to that of control cells , alloWing the iden - tiﬁcation of potentially t0xic samples. Longer incubation times , and measurement of glucose utilisation or metabolism , alloWs detection of alterations in any of the pathWays that are inVolVed in glucose metabolism , not only in glucose transport. Table 1 summarises the responses measured in the three ce1l lines. This combination coVers the mechanism of action of all classes of hypog1ycaemic drugs currently aVailable for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , except those that reduce intestinal glucose absorption.

[ 0154 ] Adult male Wistar rats ( 200 - 250 g ) Were used throughout the studies. Adult male Wistar rats Were injected intra muscularly With streptoz0tocin ( STZ ) , at a dose of 36 mg / kg , to reduce 0r deplete their insulin producing cell numbers and induce hyperglycaemia at leVels typical of type 1 diabetes or late stage T2D. Rats Were fasted for 3 hours but Were giVen drinking Water ad libitum. At 72 hours after STZ injection , blood samples Were taken from the tail Vein. Plasma g1uc0se c0ncentrations Were determined by using a glucometer ( Precision Q. I. D. ; Abb0tt Lab0ratories ) using the glucose. N0V. lO , 201l. oxidase method. Rats With a blood glucose leVel of more than 300% of the fasting leVel Were considered diabetic and Were selected f0r the studies. [ 0155 ] Acute Effect of the Extract on Plasma Glucose in STZ Rats.

[ 0168 ] Similar efﬁcacy to Thiazolidines and insulin ( in fat ce1l studies ) and Biguanides ( in Chang liVer cells ) in increased glucose uptake has been demonstrated With Plant 2 extract. [ 0169 ] Treatment With the extract Was effectiVe in reducing plasma glucose 1eVels in streptozot0cin treated ( late stage T2D ) . [ 0170 ] The extract displays encouraging efﬁcacy in normalizing compromised glucose leVels. [ 0171 ] Experiment II. [ 0172 ] The present experiment elucidates the optimal dose of the plant extract according to the present inVenti0n for reducing plasma glucose leVels. In this experiment monkeys Were used in order to resemble the situation of a human as closely as possible. [ 0173 ] Justiﬁcation and Validation for Use. [ 0174 ] The VerVet monkey ( Chl0r0cebus aethi0ps ) , also ca1led African Green monkey , is one of tWo African nonhuman primate species , most commonly utilized in biomedical research and endemic to S0uthern Africa. With some exceptions , the use of nonhuman primates internationally has been inﬂuenced more by geopo1itica1 and logistical rather than biological considerations. The VerVet monkey is taxonomically closely related to the macaques ( i. e. rhesus ) , since all bel0ng to the same subfamily ( Fairbanks 2002 ) . [ 0175 ] Although VerVet monkeys are used in many ﬁelds including Virology , bacteriology , parasitology , neurology , toxicology , reproduction and cell biology , they haVe proVen to be particularly useful in the areas of cardi0Vascular and metabolic disease. As a result , the literature abounds With information and data , Validating this Well established model ( de Vries et al. 2007 , Fairbanks 2002 , Fincham et al. 1998 , KaVanagh et al. 2007 , LouW et al. 1997 , Martin et al. 1990 , Rudel et al. 1981 , Smuts et al. 1992 , Suckling and Jackson 1993 , Wallace et al. 2005 , Weight et al. l988 ) . [ 0176 ] It is imp0rtant to stress that VerVet monkeys deVelop spontaneous obesity , insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes ( Fairbanks 2002 , Francis et al. 1999 , KaVannagh et al. 2007 , Tigno et al. 2005 ) . As much as 25% fema1es and 16% males of a particular c0lony haVe been reported to be obese ( KaVannagh et al. 2007 ) . As humans , non human primates deVelop all the associated complications including renal , Vascular and neurological ( Tigno et al. 2005 ) . In some VerVet monkey populations as much as 4% can haVe abnormally high plasma g1uc0se concentrations ( Fairbanks 2002 , KaVanagh et al. 2007 ) , and there is a strong positiVe associati0n betWeen Waist circumference , increased plasma insulin as Well as plasma triglyceride concentrations ( KaVannagh et al. 2007 ) . It has also been established that obesity and associated plasma lipids and other risk factors are heritable in this species ( KaVannagh et al. 2007 ) . [ 0177 ] It is also imp0rtant to note that VerVet monkeys deVelop spontanous atherosclerosis and resp0nd Well to. N0V. lO , 201l. experimental nutritional manipulations to produce dyslipidaemia and ultimately atherosclerosis ( Fairbanks 2002 , Rudel et al. 1981 , Fincham et al. 1998 , Suckling and Jackson 1993 , ) . The associated underlying mechanisms and lesions model the human condition ( Fincham et al. 1996 , Fincham et al. 1998 , Rudel et al. 1981 ) , and VerVet monkeys are responsiVe to Well recorded older and more noVel pharmacological. interVention strategies ( Fincham et al. 1996 , St. Clair et al. 1981 , Wallace et al. 2005 ) . [ 0178 ] Primate Management. [ 0179 ] In the present study primate management and care Was according to the documented. [ 0180 ] Standard Operating Procedures ( Mdhluli 2005 ) and the MRC Guidelines on the Use of Animals in Research and Training , the National Code for Animal Use in Research , Education , Diagnosis and Testing of Drugs and related Substances in South Africa , and the Veterinary and Para - Veterinary Professions Act 0f 1997 : Rules relating to the practicing of the Para - Veterinary Profession of Laboratory Animal Technologist. [ 0181 ] Choice of Monkeys and their Permanent Identiﬁcation. [ 0182 ] A1l indiVidua1s selected for this study Were healthy adult males and females , 2nd generation captiVe bred , With an aVerage Weight of 5.56 kg ( : 0.724 ) and 3.16 kg ( : 0.266 ) respectiVely. AVerage age Was 12 years for males and 7 years for females. Female VerVet monkeys mature sexually in captiVity at about 2.5 to 3.0 years of age , and males at about 3.0 to 4.0 years ( Eley 1992 ) . [ 0183 ] A1l indiViduals Were free of oVert path0logy as judged by physical examination and preVious clinical record , of normal Weight for age , and identiﬁed With a pe1manent number in ink tattoo. Additionally , cages Were marked according to indiVidual number , group designation , and experiment number. [ 0184 ] EnVironmental Conditions. [ 0185 ] A1l VerVet monkeys used in this study Were maintained in the Primate Unit of the Technology and InnoVation directorate of the MRC under identica1 housing conditions. The facility consists of 14 fully air conditioned animal rooms in a closed indoor enVironment that is maintained at 24 - 260 C. , a humidity of about 45 % , about 15 - 20 air changes per hour and a photoperiod of 12 hours. All rooms are kept under positiVe pressure and haVe separate air supply. [ 0186 ] Housing. [ 0187 ] Caging Was singly for the duration of the study , and consisted of 90x70><120 cm suspended galVanized steel cages , With 24 m0nkeys being maintained in one room. Animal rooms Were sanitized once dai1y. The cage size is consistent With the requirements of the South African National Code for single animals. [ 0188 ] Food and Water. [ 0189 ] Water Was aVai1able ad lib Via an automatic Watering deVice. The maize meal based maintenance diet Was produced in the Primate Unit , and has supported good grthh and reproduction for three generations ( Seier 1986 ) . SeVenty gram of the dry maize meal , Which contains added micro - and macronutrients , Was mixed With Water to a stiff consistency and fed to the monkeys at 7 : 00 am , ll : 00 am and another 70 g at 3 : 00 pm but Without the added nutrients. This supplies 2412 kJ per monkey per day With 12% energy from protein , 20% from fat and 68% fr0m carb0hydrates. In addition , apples or oranges are fed at noon at 70 g / m0nkey / day. The. US 20l1 / 0275579 Al. detai1ed composition of the diet has been described preViously ( Fincham et al. 1987 , Venter et al. 1993 ) . [ 0190 ] Supporting Facilities. [ 0191 ] All actiVities of the Primate Unit are fully physically separated by dedicated areas and rooms for cage sanitation , food preparation and storage , st0rage and formulation of compounds under inVestigation , procedures ( i. e. blood sampling ) , operations ( theatre ) and necropsy. [ 0192 ] EnVironmental Enrichment. [ 0193 ] Single cages are ﬁtted With resting perches , 80 cm aboVe the cage ﬁoor , foraging pans and communication panels , Which enable gro0ming and physica1 contact With conspeciﬁcs. Exercise cages measuring 90x70><200 cm area aVailable three times / Week to each monkey and enable leaVing the home cages and engaging in certain actiVities that are not p0ssible in home cage ( Seier and de Lange 1996 ) . The cage also enables 360° communicati0n With all other animals in the room as Wel1 as the adjacent room ( through glass panels ) . Soft music and bird sounds are broadcasted into each animal room to relieVe auditory monotony. Other enrichment methods haVe been described preViously ( Seier et al. 2004 ) . [ 0194 ] Health and Disease Control. [ 0195 ] All animals Were tested for TB f0ur times per year by injecting 3000 units of PPD intradermally into the upper eyelid. MRC staff and students , as Well as serVice proViders , Were tested for TB tWice per year by culturing bronchial secretions for Mycobacteria. According to Primate Unit SOPs , additional bacteriological and serological testing is carried out on the VerVet monkeys from time to time , and is consistent With accepted standards ( FELASA 1998 ) . This includes testing for Sh1 ' ge / / a , Sa / m0nel / a , Campy / 0bacter and Yersima. [ 0196 ] Handling of VerVet monkeys , administration of substance , and co1lection of samples. [ 0197 ] Procedures and handling of the VerVet monkeys Were according to Primate Unit SOPs , and all other guidelines mentioned in the preamble. They are carried out and / or superVised by fully qualiﬁed and experienced laboratory animal technologists Who are registered With the SA Veterinary C0unci1 in laboratory animal technology. [ 0198 ] ObserVations. [ 0199 ] All animals haVe been obserVed three times / day to determine p0tential physical side effects of the treatment. The folloWing criteria Were used : posture , coordination , locomotion , actiVity , behaViour ( alert , fearful , aggressiVe , confused , depressed , Vocalization ) , discharge from oriﬁces , appetite , condition of feces and urine. [ 0200 ] Preparations of GMP ARC61. [ 0201 ] Preparation of a plant extract in accordance With the present inVention Was made for testing of bio - actiVity in the primate model. “Fermented” Aspa / athus / inearis leaVes and stems , pretested for the bio - actiVity , Was processed in a cGMP facility. [ 0202 ] Manufacturing Details. [ 0203 ] The manufacturing process for both products comprised the folloWing unit operations : extraction of the plant material , separation 0f the extract and sma1l particulate matter , eVaporation , HTST sterilization of the concentrate , Vacuum drying of the concentrate and sieVing of the ﬁnal product poWder. [ 0204 ] Preparation of Extract. [ 0205 ] The plant material ( Aspala1hus / inearis leaVes and stems ) Was extracted in tWo subsets of 300 kg per percolator. Puriﬁed Water ( 3000 kg ) , preheated t0 93° C. Was introduced. N0V. lO , 201l. into the percolator from the top at a rate of 1 : 10 and the resulting extract Was circulated f0r 35 min. At completion of extraction sub set 1 Was drained to giVe a total of 2445 kg of aqueous extract With a dry residue of 1.24% ( dry extract yield —10.1% ) . Sub set 2 Was extracted in a similar manner , but after draining an additional 30O kg of puriﬁed Water Was ﬁushed through the extracted plant material t0 giVe 2771 kg aqueous extract With a / / dry residue 0f 1.25% ( dry extract yield —11.6% ) . [ 0206 ] The extract Was centrifuged Warm at a ﬂoW rate of 700 1 / h , With a draining cycle of the sediment eVery 3O min. The ﬁnal extract recoVered after centrifugation Was 513O kg With a dry residue yield of 1.24%. [ 0207 ] After centrifugation the aqueous extract an inlet temperature 0f betWeen <78° C. Was concentrated With a plate eVaporator under Vacuum at <55° C. to 310 kg and a dry residue of21.95%. [ 0208 ] The concentrate Was HTST steri1ized at 121 - 123° C. ( ca 68 s ) at a ﬂoW rate of 385 - 445 l / h. The concentrate Was cooled to <25° C. after sterilization. Puriﬁed Water Was used to Wash out the plant , giVing a ﬁnal sterilized c0ncentrate of 322 kg With a dry residue of 20%. [ 0209 ] The sterilized concentrate Was dried in 8 Vacuum drier ( Model 2000 ) at a product temperature <35° C. for 36 h and then 48° C. for 24 h. After drying the poWer Was sieVed through tWo sieVes ( 2 mm foll0Wed by 0.5 mm ) to rem0Ve lumps that formed during the rotation of the paddles in the Vacuum drier. [ 0210 ] The sieVed p0Wder Was placed in 0ne PE bag ( 51.2 kg ) , Which Were then sealed in an aluminium coated ﬁbre drum. [ 0211 ] Plant Material. [ 0212 ] The HPLC ﬁngerprint of the p1ant material Was determined 0n an aqueous extract in accordance With the present inVention. The extract Was prepared by extracting the plant material With deionised , puriﬁed Water at 90 - 93° C. ( giVing 1 : 10 ratio ) for 30 min in a Water bath , ﬁltering Warm through Whatman no. 4 ﬁlter paper and fr0zen , Whereafter it Was freeze - dried. For HPLC ana1ysis the freeze - dried extract Was reconstituted in puriﬁed Water. [ 0213 ] Results. [ 0214 ] The HPLC ﬁngerprint of the plant material Was determined 0n an aqueous extract in accordance With the present inVention. The extract Was prepared by extracting the plant material With deionised , puriﬁed Water at 90 - 93° C. ( giVing 1 : 10 ratio ) for 30 min in a Water bath , ﬁltering Warm through Whatman no. 4 ﬁlter paper and frozen , Whereafter it Was freeze - dried. For HPLC analysis the freeze - dried extract Was reconstituted in puriﬁed Water. [ 0215 ] The HPLC ﬁngerprint 0f the ﬁnal product ( GMP ARC61 ) Was determined on the extract reconstituted in puri - ﬁed Water. [ 0216 ] VerVet Monkey Dose Optimization Study. [ 0217 ] Controls. [ 0218 ] Three monkeys Where randomized into a control group. The monkeys in the control group receiVed a 70 g ration of maintenance diet ( molded into ball ) but Without the dry extract , three times a day for 7 days. On day 7 the monkeys Were fasted oVernight ( 13 hours ) , a baseline b1ood sample Was collected before the monkeys Were fed the ball maintenance diet bolus. Thereafter blood samples Were collected hourly for a six hour period by femoral Venipuncture under Ketamine anaesthesia ( 10 mg / kg bodyWeight intramuscular injection ) . US 20l1 / 0275579 Al. [ 0219 ] Experimental Groups. [ 0220 ] Three monkeys randomized into four experimental groups receiVing O.1 mg / kg , 0.3 mg / kg , 1 mg / kg , 2.5 mg / kg , 5 mg / kg and 25 mg / kg GMP ARC 61 ( extract of Aspa / athus 11nearis leaVes and stems as described aboVe ) three times a day. All the monkeys in the respectiVe experimental groups receiVed a pre - Weighed aliquot of plant extract moulded into a 7O g ball of maintenance diet as a bolus , three times a day for 7 days. On day 7 after the monkeys Were fasted oVernight ( l 3 hours ) , a baseline blood sample Was collected before the monkeys Were fed the maintenance diet bolus containing the respectiVe amounts 0f dry extract. Thereafter b1ood samples Were collected hourly f0r a six hour period by fem0ral Venipuncture under Ketamine anaesthesia ( 1O mg / kg bodyWeight intramuscular injection ) . [ 0221 ] Summary of Results. [ 0222 ] Control Group. [ 0223 ] In the c0ntrol group none of the three monkeys tested shoWed a decline from the baseline Values during the ﬁrst tWo hours after receiVing the portion of moulded maintenance diet. Thereafter in tWo of the three monkeys there Was a reducti0n of the glucose Values When compared to their baseline Values. [ 0224 ] Blood Glucose Values in the 1.0 mg / kg GMP ARC61 Treatment Group.
