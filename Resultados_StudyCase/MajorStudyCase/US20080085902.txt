[ 0012 ] ln the center 0f the netW0rk regulating the gr0Wth and dilferentiati0n 0f the Vascular system and its 00mp0 - nents , b0th during embry0nic deVel0pment and n0rmal gr0Wth and in a Wide number 0f path0l0gical an0malies and diseases , lies the angi0genic fact0r , kn0Wn as VEGF 0r VGEF ; 0riginally termed Vascular permeability fact0r ( VPF ) , al0ng With its cellular recept0rs. See Breier et al. , Trends Ce / / Bi0 / , V0l. 6 , pp. 454 - 456 ( l996 ) and references cited therein. [ 0013 ] VEGF is a dimeric , disulﬁde - linked 46 - kDa gly - c0pr0tein pr0duced by n0rmal cell lines and tum0r cell lines. lt is an end0thelial cell - speciﬁc mit0gen , sh0Ws angi0genic actiVity in in ViV0 test systems , e. g. , rabbit c0mea , is chem0tactic f0r end0thelial cells and m0n0cytes , and induces plasmin0gen actiVat0rs in end0thelial cells , Which are then inV0lVed in the pr0te0lytic degradati0n 0f eXtracellular matriX during the f0rmati0n 0f capillaries. Anumber 0f is0f0rms 0f VEGF are kn0Wn , Which sh0W c0mparable bi0l0gical actiVity , but diEer in the type 0f cells that secrete them and in their heparin - binding capacity. In additi0n , there are 0ther members 0f the VEGF family , such as placenta gr0Wth fact0r and VEGF - C. [ 0014 ] VEGF recept0rs are transmembran0us recept0r tyr0sine kinases. They are characterized by an eXtracellular d0main With seVen immun0gl0bulin - like d0mains and an intracellular tyr0sine kinase d0main. Vari0us types 0f VEGF recept0r are kn0Wn , e. g. , VEGFR - l , VEGFR - 2 and VEGFR - 3. [ 0015 ] A large number 0f human tum0rs , especially gli0 - mas and carcin0mas , eXpress high leVels 0f VEGF and its recept0rs. This has led t0 the hyp0thesis that the VEGF. Apr. lO , 2008. released by tum0r cells 00uld stimulate the gr0Wth 0f bl00d capillaries and the pr0liferati0n 0f tum0r end0thelium in a paracrine manner and thus , thr0ugh the impr0Ved bl00d supply , accelerate tum0r gr0Wth. lncreased VEGF eXpres - si0n 00uld eXplain the 00currence 0f cerebral 0edema in patients With gli0ma. Direct eVidence 0f the r0le 0f VEGF as a tum0r angi0genesis fact0r in ViV0 has been 0btained fr0m studies in Which VEGF eXpressi0n 0r VEGF actiVity Was inhibited. This Was achieVed With antib0dies Which inhibit VEGF actiVity , With d0minant - negatiVe VEGFR - 2 mutants Which inhibited signal transducti0n , 0r With the use 0f antisense - VEGF RNA techniques. All appr0aches led t0 a reducti0n in the gr0Wth 0f gli0ma cell lines 0r 0ther tum0r cell lines in ViV0 as a result 0f inhibited tum0r angi0genesis. [ 0016 ] Angi0genesis is regarded as an abs0lute prerequisite f0r th0se tum0rs Which gr0W bey0nd a maximum diameter 0f ab0ut l - 2 m ; up t0 this limit , 0Xygen and nutrients may be supplied t0 the tum0r cells by diffusi0n. EVery tum0r , regardless 0f its 0rigin and its cause , is thus dependent 0n angi0genesis f0r its gr0Wth after it has reached a certain size. [ 0017 ] Three principal mechanisms play an imp0rtant part in the actiVity 0f angi0genesis inhibit0rs against tum0rs : l ) lnhibiti0n 0f the gr0Wth 0f Vessels , especially capillaries , int0 aVascular resting tum0rs , With the result that there is n0 net tum0r gr0Wth 0Wing t0 the balance that is achieVed betWeen ap0pt0sis and pr0liferati0n ; 2 ) PreVenti0n 0f the migrati0n 0f tum0r cells 0Wing t0 the absence 0f bl00d flOW t0 and fr0m tum0rs ; and 3 ) lnhibiti0n 0f end0thelial cell pr0liferati0n , thus aV0iding the paracrine gr0Wth - stimulating effect exerted 0n the surr0unding tissue by the end0t - helial cells Which n0rmally line the Vessels. [ 0018 ] Accruing eVidence suggests that VEGF inhibit0rs are eVen m0re eﬂiCaCi0us When used in C0mbinati0n With 0ther chem0therapeutic agents. There are b0th synergistic and additiVe adVantages , b0th f0r eﬁicacy and safety. Therapeutic elfeCts 0f C0mbinati0ns 0f chem0therapeutic agents With VEGF inhibit0rs can result in loWer safe d0sages ranges 0f each c0mp0nent in the c0mbinati0n. SUMMARY OF THE lNVENTlON.
