DITHIOCARBAMATE ANTIVIRAL AGENTS AND METHODS 0F USING SAME. This app1icati0n is a U. S. nati0na1 phase app1icati0n under 35 U. S. C. § 371 0f lnternati0na1 Applicati0n N0. PCT / AT02 / 00206 ﬂ1ed 15 Jul. 2002 , Which claims pri0rity t0 Austrian Applicati0ns N0. A 1103 / 01 ﬂ1ed 16 Ju1. 200l , N0. A 1102 / 01 ﬁ1ed 16 Ju1. 2001 , N0. A 1973 / 01 ﬁ1ed 17 Dec. 2001 , and N0. A 1972 / 01 ﬁ1ed 17 Dec. 2001 , the disc10sures 0f each 0f Which are inc0rp0rated herein in their entirety. The inVenti0n c0ncerns the use 0f dithi0carbamate 00m - p0unds as We1l as a disinfectant and a pr0cess f0r disinfecting surfaces , media 0r ce11 cu1tures. There are many Viruses Which cause diseases in the respirat0ry tract 0f humans and mammals. Alth0ugh these respirat0ry - path0genic Viruses can diﬂer structurally and be10ng t0 di1ferent Virus fami1ies , they a1l haVe in c0mm0n that they can penetrate mm the b0dy thr0ugh the respirat0ry tract by , f0r instance , attacking speciﬂc ce1ls in that tract , such as the epithe1ial ce11 1ayer in the respirat0ry tract , alVe0lar cells , lung cells , etc. The classical sympt0ms 0f ﬂu are c0mm0n t0 a11 0f them , Which ﬂu is characterized by 10ca1 inﬂammati0n and disease sympt0ms in the respirat0ry tract ( such as a runny n0se , h0arseness , c0ughing , Vesic1es , s0re thr0at ) . V1ral infecti0ns , particularly in the respirat0ry tract , pr0 - duce path010gical changes in the cel1s aﬂected thr0ugh 0xidatiVe stress , especia11y in epithe1ia1 ce11s. ReactiVe 0xygen intermediates ( ROls ) , such as are pr0duced by 1euk0 - cytes , epithelial pulm0nary cells 0r xanthine 0xidases , are c0nsidered mediat0rs 0f these Virus - induced cell injuries. ActiVati0n 0f the 0xidant - speciﬂc transcripti0n fact0r NFKKB ( Nuc1ear Fact0r KB ) can 0ccur in the c0urse 0f this 0xidatiVe stress. NFKB has been f0und in the m0st Varied ce1l types and has been related t0 actiVati0n 0f genes f0r inﬂammat0ry and immune resp0nses. Anti0xidants can bl0ck actiVati0n 0f NFKB by trapping the ROls , Which , 0therWise , W0u1d cause such actiVati0n. Theref0re , the use 0f anti0xidants has been pr0p0sed , especially f0r treatment 0f infecti0ns With latent Viruses. lt has been f0und , th0ugh , that these latent infecti0ns cann0t be treated effectiVe1y With sing1e anti0xidants a10ne , rather , they can be treated effectiVe1y , if at a11 , 0n1y by c0mbined therapy using a mixture 0f diﬂerent anti0xidants ( i. e. , anti0xidants haVing different acti0ns ) and 0ther Virus - inhibiting substances ( U. S. Pat. N0. 5 , 686 , 436 ) . lt has n0t yet been p0ssib1e t0 attain inhibiti0n 0f Vira1 rep1icati0n , 0r eVen 0f Virus infecti0n , by anti0xidants , and especia1ly n0t 0f infecti0ns With inﬂuenza 0r pic0ma Viruses ( Kn0bil et al. , Am. J. Physi0l. 274 ( 1 ) ( 1998 ) ( 134 - 142 ) . On the 0ther hand , the Vari0us anti0xidants pr0p0sed f0r c0mbatting Virus infecti0ns are Very diiferent in their anti - 0xidatiVe actiVities. F0r instance , L - asc0rbic acid and Vitamin E serVe f0r the pr0tecti0n 0f glutathi0ne ; Vitamins K , A and E act as antag0nists 0f per0xynitrite and 0ther str0ng 0xidants in the b0dy. Anti - inﬂammat0ry ster0ids , n0n - g1u - c0c0rtic0ida1 lazar0ids , dithi0carbamates and N - acetyl - L - cysteine haVe been described as inhibit0rs 0f NFKB actiVa - ti0n. V1ruses can be classiﬁed as DNA 0r RNA Viruses , depending 0n their carrier 0f genetic inf0rmati0n , the nucleic acid being sing1e - stranded 0r d0ub1e - stranded and surr0unded by a pr0tein enVe10pe. The sing1e - stranded RNA 0f these RNA Viruses eecurs. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 2. The human rhin0Viruses ( HRV ) c1assiﬂed in the pic0r - naViruses are the principal cause 0f the W0r1dWide c0mm0n c01d. The frequent 0ccurrence 0f HRV , the risk 0f seVere sec0ndary infecti0ns , and the ec0n0mic eifect 0f medica1 00sts , Visits t0 physicians , and sickness - 1eaVes 0f emp10yees make HRVs maj0r path0gens , Which sh0u1d be taken seri - 0usly. ln spite 0f their frequent 0ccurrence , at this time , there is n0 reliab1e treatment f0r this Vira1 disease 0ther than sympt0matic treatment. On the 0ther hand , the 00nsequences 0f a rhin0Virus infecti0n , f0r instance , are n0t s0 seri0us 0r eVen 11fe threatening that it is acceptable t0 take medicati0ns haVing a high risk 0f side eﬂects. Theref0re , agents t0 be used against such Viruses must exhibit 11tt1e 0r n0 side eﬂects. The gr0up 0f anima1 pic0rnaViruses includes the equine rhinitis A Virus ( ERAV ) , Which , 1ike f00t and m0uth disease Virus ( FMV ) , bel0ngs t0 the genus 0f the aphth0Viruses. Other imp0rtant Virus families resp0nsible f0r diseases in the respirat0ry tract inc1ude the 0rth0myx0Viridae and paramyx0Viridae , With human inﬂuenza Virus as the m0st imp0rtant representatiVe. The 0ccurrence 0f neW pandemic inﬂuenza strains , usu - a11y , is c0nsidered due t0 neW subtypes c0ntaining a neW hemagglutinin 0r neuraminidase gene. These neW Viruses diﬂer immun010gica11y fr0m preVi0us1y circu1ating inﬂu - enza Viruses. lnﬂuenza A and B Viruses require 8 RNA segments t0 be infecti0us , Whi1e lnﬂuenza C Viruses need 0n1y 7. lnﬂuenza A , B and C Viruses can pr0duce h0m0typic reass0rtants in ViV0 , but n0t betWeen the types. ln the0ry , 256 reass0rtants c0uld be pr0duced fr0m the 8 segments 0f tW0 lnﬂuenza Viruses ; but such rand0m segregati0n d0es n0t 0ccur because sOme pr0teins require their strain speciﬂc partner at the pr0tein1eVe1. That Was dem0nstrated particu - 1ar1y clear1y f0r the AVian lnﬂuenza Virus A / chicken / Germany / 34 ( H7N1 ) FPV R0st0ck HA , Which is c0ded by segment 4 , Which can f0rm a functi0nal Virus speciﬂcally 0nly With its strain speciﬂc M2 pr0tein , Which is c0ded by segment 7.

NeVertheless , inﬂuenza is sti1l a cause 0f m0rbidity and m0rta1ity in the W0r1d and a principa1 cause 0f sickness and death in patients With Weak immune systems and in 01der pers0ns. The antiVira1 actiVity 0f Amantadine and Rimantadine reduces the durati0n 0f the sympt0ms 0f clinical inﬂuenza , but imp0rtant side effects and appearance 0f resistant mutants haVe been described ( Fie1ds et a1. , Vir010gy , 3m Editi0n ( 1995 ) , Lippinc0tt - RaVen Pub1. , Phi1ade1phia , V01. 1 , p. 434 - 436 ) . At present , a neW gr0up 0f antiViral agents , Which inhibit inﬂuenza Virus neuraminidase is 0n the market. ZanamiVir and Ose1tamiVir are examples 0f inhibit0rs 0f inﬂuenza A and B Virus neuraminidase. HOWeVer , these medicati0ns 0n1y reduce the durati0n 0f the sympt0ms. A pr0cess f0r suppressing the pr0pagati0n 0f retr0Viruses and latent Viruses , such as HlV , in humans is described in U. S. Pat. N0. 5 , 686 , 436. ln that pr0cess , a medicati0n 00ntaining , am0ng 01her ingredients , anti0xidants and NFKB inducti0n inhibit0rs is administered. ln c0ntrast , f0r eﬂectiVe. either as the p1us - strand ( mRNA ) 0r the minus strand. This 65 acti0n against infecti0ns With respirat0ry Viruses , the Virus. Virus genetic inf0rmati0n can als0 0ccur in seVeral segments , as in the case 0f the inﬂuenza Virus. must be attacked Whi1e it is still in the acute infecti0n phase. This is a treatment that can be used 0n1y 0n the 1eVe1 0f the. US 7 , 282 , 599 B2. 3. 1atent Viruses and is n0t suitable t0 preVent 0r treat acute Vira1 infecti0ns in the respirat0ry tract. Thus , there is a need f0r a high1y eﬂectiVe substance that is actiVe against Virus infecti0ns in the respirat0ry tract , especia11y in humans , Which causes feW if any side eﬂects , is c0st - e1fectiVe , and can be pr0duced in 1arge quantities. The 0bject 0f the present inVenti0n is attained by using dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds haVing the structura1 f0rmu1a RlR2NCS2H , in Which R1 and R2 , independent1y 0f each 0ther , represent a straight 0r branched Cl - C4 a1kyl , 0r , With the nitr0 gen at0m , f0rm an a1iphatic ring With 4 t0 6 C at0ms , in Which R1 , R2 , 0r the a1iphatic ring is 0pti0na1ly substituted With 0ne 0r m0re substituents se1ected fr0m OH , NO2 , NH2 , COOH , SH , F , C1 , Br , l , methy1 0r ethy1 , and 0xidized f0rms 0f these c0mp0unds , in particu1ar dimers there0f , as We1l as pharmaceutica11y acceptable sa1ts there0f , t0 prepare an agent f0r treating 0r preVenting an infecti0n by RNA Viruses , Which attack the respirat0ry tract and cause disease there. ln the inVenti0n , ‘respirat0ry tract means all the 0rgans and regi0ns fr0m the b0dy 0penings ( n0se , m0uth , eyes ( including the tear ducts ) and ears ) t0 the pu1m0nary alVe01i. Here , the pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e sa1ts , in particu1ar , are Na , K , Ca , Mg , NH4 and Zn. lt has n0W been f0und , surprising1y , and f0r the ﬁrst time that the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds can be used eﬂectiVely against infecti0ns by RNA Viruses , Which attack the respirat0ry tract and cause disease there ; these Viruses are ca11ed “respirat0ry RNA Viruses” in this app1icati0n. C0ntrary to the 0bserVati0ns 0f Kn0bil et al. , ( Am. J. Physi0l. ( 1998 ) , pages 134 - 142 ) , in the sc0pe 0f the present inVenti0n , an antiViral acti0n 0f the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds against infecti0ns With respirat0ry RNA Viruses , such as HRV and inﬂuenza infecti0ns , c0uld clearly be sh0Wn. This is particu1arly surprising because 0ther anti0xidants d0 n0t exhibit this antiViral acti0n against respirat0ry RNA Viruses , and the change 0f the red0x p0tentia1 is n0t s01e1y resp0nsib1e f0r the antiVira1 acti0n 0f the dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n. F0r examp1e , it can clearly be sh0Wn acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n that the anti0xidants V1tamin C , Vitamin E , 2 - mercapt0ethan0l and N - acety1 - L - cysteine haVe n0 acti0n at a11 against respirat0ry RNA Viruses. Further - m0re , the effectiVeness 0f the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds against infecti0ns With respirat0ry RNA Viruses and the pr0pagati0n 0f these Viruses cann0t be ascribed sO1e1y t0 inhibiti0n 0f NFKB actiVati0n , much rather , it has been sh0Wn that the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds , Which are underst00d t0 inc1ude eVen the 0xidized f0rms , in the present applicati0n , and especially the dimers , speciﬁ - cally preVent pr0pagati0n 0f respirat0ry RNA Viruses. DE 19 63 223 A c0ncerns an agent f0r treating Virus infecti0ns in the brain , in Which the agent is said t0 inV01Ve an inhibit0r 0f bi0synthesis 0f the m0n0amines n0radrena - 1in , d0pamine and 5 - hydr0xytryptamine. The examp1e presented in this d0cument sh0Ws the acti0n 0f a - methylty - r0sine methyl ester 0n mice infected With Herpes simp1ex.

This d0cument menti0ns many Viruses , inc1uding RNA Viruses , Pic0rnaViridae am0ng 0thers. The d0cument als0 giVes many examples 0f thi01 c0mp0unds , inc1uding dithi0carbamate , quite general1y. Only the f0l10Wing examp1es Were sh0Wn fr0m the many diﬂerent p0tentia1 c0mbinati0ns : as thi0l c0mp0unds , N - acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , cysteine , cysteine hydr0ch10ride and N , S - diacety1cysteine ethyl ester ( DACEE ) . Only hepatitis B and Vaccinia Virus Were sh0Wn as Virus diseases. Thus , n0t 0nly Were n0 examples sh0Wn f0r the maj0rity 0f the c0mp0unds and Virus diseases ; but it has als0 turned 0ut that the treatment discl0sed in that d0cument d0es n0t 0perate t0 the extent described : many pic0rnaViruses ( th0se Which d0 n0t attack the respirat0ry tract , but nerVe ce11s ) are n0t inhibited by PDTC , and their pr0pagati0n is n0t reduced. Thus , n0t all c0mbinati0ns 0f Virus induced diseases and thi01 c0mp0unds are successfu1 , and the use 0f selected dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds se1ected acc0rding t0 the inVention—th0se n0t disc10sed in WO 95 / 03792 A1—is n0t made 0bVi0us f0r treatment 0r preVenti0n 0f infecti0n by respira - t0ry RNA Viruses.

An antimicr0bial agent c0mprising a dimethyldithi0carbamate c0mp0und is described in DE 25 55 730 A. This 00mp0und is a c0mp1ex 0f 8 - hydr0xyquin011ne—meta1—N , N - dimethy1dithi0carbamate. But that d0cument disc10ses 0nly fungicidal and antibacterial acti0n.

Fl0ry et al. , J. Bi0l.

Tai , D. l. , et al. , Hepat0l0gy , March 2000 , 31 ( 3 ) , pages 785 - 787 , c0ncerns a study 0f inhibiti0n 0f NKFB actiVati0n by PDTC , in Which it is assumed that an HCV infecti0n c0u1d pr0duce anti - ap0pt0sis by actiVati0n 0f NFKB. SchWarz et a1. , 1998 ( J.

That is in str0ng. 0f applicati0n , and it cann0t be c0mpared With the app1ica - 65 c0ntrast t0 the data presented here : these examples can sh0W. ti0n acc0rding t0 this inVenti0n , and thus d0es n0t make it 0bVi0us , either. clear1y that the dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n preVent n0t 0n1y replicati0n 0f the re1ated rhin0Vi - .

Theref0re , acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n , the inhibiti0n 0f NFKB is n0t the critica1 fact0r in the eifectiVeness 0f the dithi0carbamate c0m - p0unds. Neither is the inVentiVe antiVira1 acti0n 0f the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds dependent 0n a c0mbinati0n 0f particular substances. The inVentiVe dithi0carbamate 00m - p0unds can be used c0mp1ete1y al0ne , independent 0f the further additiVes , especial1y anti0xidants , as is abs01utely essentia1 acc0rding t0 U. S. Pat. N0. 5 , 686 , 436 f0r an antiretr0Virus acti0n 0f NFKB - actiVati0n inbibit0rs , because , surprising1y , the antiVira1 acti0n is n0t related 0nly t0 ﬁghting 0xidatiVe stress , but als0 the infecti0n / rep1icati0n can be inhibited by the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate 00mp0unds. lt c0uld be sh0Wn that the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds induce genes , Which act as anti0xidant - induced transcripti0n fact0rs ( Meyer et al. , EMBO J . , 12 , 2005 - 20l 5 , 1993 ) . The heter0dimeric transcripti0n fact0r , AP1 , can be induced by NAC and the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate 00m - p0unds , leading t0 DNA binding and transactiVati0n. The actiVati0n 0f AP1 by the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0m - p0unds depends 0n pr0tein synthesis and inV01Ves transcrip - ti0n 0f c - jun and c - f0s genes. HOWeVer , the actiVati0n 0f AP1 , a10ne , is n0t resp0nsib1e f0r the str0ng inVentiVe inhibiti0n 0f Viruses. Pyrr0lidine dithi0carbamate ( PDTC ) is already kn0Wn as a pr00xidant and anti - 0xidant , inhibit0r 0f actiVati0n 0f the transcripti0n fact0r NFKB , zinc ion0ph0r , and meta1 - che1ating agent. PDTC is described in Sherman et a1. , Bi0chem. Bi0phys. Res. C0mm. , 191 ( 3 ) , 1301 - 1308 , 1993 , as an inhibit0r 0f NFKB actiVati0n and 0f NO synthase. WO Ol / 00193 A2 c0ncerns c0mp0siti0ns c0mprising dieth - y1dithi0carbamate in the pic0m01ar and nan0m01ar range , Which exhibit a str0ng acti0n against ap0pt0sis. Acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n , it 00u1d be sh0Wn that the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds exhibit str0ng acti0n against RNA Viruses Which attack the respirat0ry tract and cause disease there—“respirat0ry RNA Viruses”—b0th in Vitr0 and in ViV0. Acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n , the infecti0n is c0unteracted already in a Very ear1y phase , eVen bef0re extensiVe cell damage 0r eVen cell death 0ccurs. ln the present inVenti0n , respirat0ry RNA Viruses are taken t0 mean any Viruses 0f humans and mamma1s that attack the b0dy Via the respirat0ry tract , i. e. , the respirat0ry passages and 1ungs , and penetrate the b0dy , triggering disease in the respirat0ry tract. ObVi0us1y , the bi0l0gical pr0cesses that 0ccur in this infecti0n are s0 similar that the acti0n 0f the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds 0ccurs eﬂicient1y in ana10g0us manner , in spite 0f the bi010gica1 heter0geneity 0f this gr0up 0f Viruses. But , 00nVerse1y , it has als0 been sh0Wn that acti0n 0f the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds , al0ne , is n0t sufficient t0 successfully c0mbat a Virus infecti0n caused by 0ther Viruses that get mm the b0dy thr0ugh 0ther r0utes 0f infecti0n and pass thr0ugh different bi010gical cycles ( e. g. , Which can be integrated mm the h0st gen0me as a latent Virus ) , 0r trigger disease in 0ther 0rgans , such as the brain. ln this respect , it has been sh0Wn , in the meantime , that treatment 0f AlDS patients With dithi0carbamates d0es n0t cause cure 0r impr0Vement 0f the patients ( Mu1ticenter rand0mized p1aceb0 - c0ntr011ed study 0f dithi0carb ( lmuthi01 ) in asympt0matic and minimal1y sympt0matic patients infected With human immun0deﬁciency Virus ( The HlV87 Study Gr0up , AlDS Res.

Because 0f th0se results , n0 further clinical studies Were d0ne With latent Viruses ( see U. S. Pat. N0. 5 , 686 , 436 ) . Acc0rding t0 the present inVenti0n , the dithi0carbamate 00mp0unds , primari1y , deVe10p their particular actiVity in an ear1y phase 0f the Viral infecti0n 0r if they are taken bef0re the infecti0n. Thus , the dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n can preVent the 0utbreak 0f a Virus infecti0n if it they are taken pr0phylactica11y , f0r examp1e , in p1aces and at times at Which there is a risk , 0r eVen an eleVated risk , 0f respirat0ry Virus infecti0ns , such as in regi0ns With epidemics 0r in c01d WaVes. The dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n are preferab1y used t0 preVent Virus infecti0n. The Virus inhibiti0n acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n is particularly preferred , but especially in the early phase 0f a respirat0ry Virus infecti0n that has a1ready 0ccurred. Then , the dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n are used With the aim 0f inhibiting rep1icati0n 0f the Viruses , i. e. , at a time bef0re persistent damage has 00curred in the infected indiVidual. ln that Way , n0t 0n1y is it p0ssible t0 preVent the c0nsequences 0f pr0gressiVe Virus infecti0n in the indiVidua1 aﬂected , but the spread 0f 0ther infecti0us Viruses t0 01her indiVidua1s is a1s0 preVented ; the danger 0f further infecti0n is minimized , Which is 0f great genera1 eﬂect and signiﬁcance f0r health p0licy , especially With respect t0 human inﬂuenza Virus. The f0110Wing Viruses , in particu1ar , are c0nsidered respirat0ry RNA Viruses in the present inVenti0n : rhin0Viruses , C0xsackie Viruses , ech0Viruses , c0r0naViruses , enter0Viruses , human 0rth0myx0Viruses ( such as inﬂuenza Virus ( A , B and C ) ) , paramyx0Viruses ( such as parainﬂuenza Virus and pneum0Virus ) , respirat0ry syncytia1 Virus ( RSV ) and 0ther RNA Viruses as 10ng as they cause disease in ( at 1east ) the respirat0ry tract. Viruses 0r Virus strains that d0 n0t cause disease in the respirat0ry tract but in an0ther 0rgan , such as the brain , e. g. , meningitis Virus , encephal0my0carditis Virus , p01i0Virus , cardi0Virus , etc. , are n0t c0Vered by the present app1icati0n. lnfecti0n 0f epithe1ia1 ce11s 0f the upper 0r loWer respirat0ry tract is c0mm0n t0 the respirat0ry RNA Viruses acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n. ln additi0n , 0ther 0rgans can be attacked. The 10ca1 inﬂammati0n that they cause in the respirat0ry tract is c0nsidered the principa1 cause 0f the typica1 sympt0ms 0f ﬂu , such as runny n0se , s0re thr0at , h0arseness , c0ughing , Vesicles , and , 0ften , feVer. The frequent 0ccurrence 0f sec0ndary infecti0ns in indiViduals With Weakened immunity is a1s0 faV0red by infecti0n With these respirat0ry Viruses. Within the sc0pe 0f the present inVenti0n , pic0rnaViruses are underst00d t0 be all the “true” pic0rnaViruses , acc0rding t0 the current classiﬁcati0n 0f the Pic0maViridae based 0n King et al. ( “Pic0rnaViridae” in “Virus Tax0n0my , SeVenth Rep0rt 0f the lntemati0na1 C0mmittee f0r the Tax0n0my 0f Viruses” , ( 2000 ) , Van Regenm0rte1 et a1. , Edit0rs ; Academic Press 657 - 673 ) , ins0far as they attack the respirat0ry tract and cause disease there , i. e. the genera Enter0Virus , Rhi - n0Virus , Aphth0Virus , Parech0Virus , Erb0Virus , K0buVirus and Tesch0Virus. These Viruses 0f the Pic0rnaViridae fami1y are characterized by simi1ar genetic structure , pr0tein 00m - p0siti0n , cultiVati0n characteristics , and ability t0 resist heat 0r Virucides. lt has been f0und that the present inVenti0n is particu1ar1y suitab1e f0r 00mbatting the human - path0genic and anima1 - path0genic members 0f the true respirat0ry Pic0rnaViridae , especia1ly th0se 0f the genera Enter0Virus ( Enter0Virus 70 , 7l , C0x sackie Virus ) and Rhin0Virus ( e. g. , human Rhi - n0Virus ) and Aphth0Virus ( e. g. , f00t and m0uth disease. US 7 , 282 , 599 B2. 7. Virus ) , Whereas the adVantages according to the inVenti0n cou1d not be dem0nstrated for other Viruses , including the pic0rnaViruses that cause latent infections , such as HAV. This is pr0bab1y a1so due t0 the fact that the gr0up 0f “true” respirat0ry pic0rnaViruses is s0 hom0gene0us , and that the path0physio10gica1 processes Which 0ccur in the infections are so similar that the dithi0carbamate compounds according to the inVention act anal0gous1y. ln the present app1icati0n , “Virus infection” is understood to be any attack 0f a respiratory Virus 0n cel1s that includes , f0r example , 0ne 0f the fol1oWing steps : beginning With docking of the Virus partic1e t0 a cel1 , and , in a 1ater stage , introduction of the genetic information 0f the Virus into the ce11 , as We11 as producti0n 0f neW Virus partic1e parts and expression 0f infecti0us Virus partic1es. Furtherm0re , it is als0 p0ssible t0 use 0xidized f0rms of these compounds , especial1y dimers of them , because they are quickly metabo1ized t0 the reduced f0rm in the organism , Which is kn0Wn per se. ln the present app1ication , “0xidized forms” are understood to be those comp0unds in Which the S gr0up is 0xidized. Disulﬁram is a preferred example 0f one such oxidized dimeric f0rm , it is a1s0 kn0Wn by the names “Antabuse” 0r “Abstiny1” , and is a tetraethy1thiuram disu1 - ﬁde ( C10H2ON2S4 ) . Disu1ﬁram is a1ready kn0Wn per se , and is used particu1arly f0r treatment of alc0ho1ics. Disu1ﬁram acts as a mediat0r in oxidoreducti0ns and inactiVates aldehyde dehydrogenase. When ethan01 is taken , acetaldehyde accumu1ates in the b0dy and exerts a pr0n0unced negatiVe eﬂect 0n the genera1 We11 being. Taking of Disu1ﬁram and alc0h0l simultaneously results in anxiety states , nausea , loss of Vision , chest pains , headaches , etc. , these sympt0ms 1asting from 3 - 4 days t0 as much as a Week. For that reason , Disu1ﬁram is administered therapeutica11y t0 a1c0h01ics , since any subsequent c0nsumption of a1coho1 sh0u1d be aVoided because 0f these seVere negatiVe effects. Other knoWn eﬂects of Disulﬁram are inhibiti0ns of enzymes such as fructose - 1 , 6 - diphosphate dehydr0genase , xanthine 0xidase , hex0kinase , a1dehyde 0xidase and d0pamine B - hydr0xy1ase. Disulﬁram is als0 used to treat pedicul0sis and scabies , and t0 treat nickel dermatitis. The metab01ism of Disu1ﬁram has a1ready been studied in detai1.

The 0xidized f0rms 0f the dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n are quite readily fat s0lub1e , and can be proVided , f0r instance , as agent for 0ral administration , the compounds being absorbed in the st0mach. The compounds cou1d also be used , in particular , as a poWder spray. Further , the 0xidized f0rms 0f the c0mp0unds acc0rding to the inVention can be proVided With hydroxy1 gr0ups t0 increase their Water s0lubi1ity so that they can made aVailab1e as an aeroso1. lf the dithiocarbamate c0mpounds according to the inVention are proVided in oxidized f0rm , and especia11y the dimeric pr0ducts , dep0t acti0n 0f this agent is attained , i. e. , the dithiocarbamate comp0unds according t0 the inVenti0n are gradually released t0 the b0dy oVer a certain period and absorbed by the body. The oxidized dithiocarbamate compounds can als0 be imp1anted , as is knoWn per se , in the body to be treated to attain this dep0t eﬂect. One preferred 00mp0und acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n is characterized in that R 1 and R2 , independent1y of each other , represent a C1 - C3 a1ky1 or f0rm an a1iphatic ring With 4 to 6. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 8. C at0ms al0ng With the nitr0 gen at0m. These haVe turned 0ut to be particu1ar1y adVantage0us for treatment 0r preVention of a respiratory RNA Virus infecti0n. lt is preferab1e for the dithi0carbamate c0mp0und t0 be se1ected from pyrro1idine dithi0carbamate ( PDTC ) and N , N - diethy1dithi0carbamate ( DDTC ) . These c0mpounds exhibit outstanding1y strong actiVity against respiratory RNA Virus infections. An especia11y preferred Virus infecti0n is an infecti0n With pic0rnaVirus , orthomyxoVirus 0r paramyxoVirus. The dithi0 - carbamate c0mp0unds according to the inVention are particu1ar1y actiVe against these Virus infections. Here , it is adVantageous f0r the 0rthomyxoVirus to be a human inﬂuenza Virus , particular1y se1ected fr0m the group consisting 0f inﬂuenza A , inﬂuenza B , inﬂuenza C or for the paramyxoVirus to be a parainﬂuenza Virus or pneumoVirus. The orthomyxoVirus , preferab1y , is a mamma1ian inﬂuenza A Virus and the picornaVirus , preferab1y , is a rhinoVirus , especia11y human 0r equine rhinoVirus , an enteroVirus , especial1y EnteroVirus 70 , 71 , or C0xsackie Virus , or an aphthoVirus , especially f00t and mouth disease Virus or equine rhinitis Virus A. As already explained aboVe , th0se Viruses or Virus strains , Which are inc1uded in the pic0rnaViruses but Which do not cause disease in the respiratory tract but rather in the brain or nerVe ce1ls , such as cardioViruses or po1i0Viruses , are excepted. These Virus infecti0ns are treated or preVented especia11y eﬂectiVely With the comp0und acc0rding to the inVenti0n. The Pic0rnaViridae fami1y inc1udes a group of sma11 RNA Viruses , including the rhinoViruses ( e. g. , human rhinoVirus ) , enteroViruses ( e. g. , EnteroVirus 70 , 71 , C0xsackie Virus , Which is kn0Wn , f0r instance , as a cause of hand , f0ot , and m0uth disease ) , aphth0Viruses ( such as f00t and m0uth disease Virus , Which causes a disease in the m0uth , as We11 as equine rhinitis Virus A ) . With foot and mouth disease , f0r example , it is 0f particular interest to use the compound acc0rding to the inVention t0 bridge the peri0d betWeen the Vaccinati0n and the time When the Vaccine bec0mes effectiVe ( ca. 10 - 12 days ) , because the Vaccinated anima1s are n0t pr0tected during that period and , under s0me circumstances , Will excrete large quantities of Virus foll0Wing infecti0n With0ut themse1Ves being sick. Therefore , the c0mp0und acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n c0u1d be administered to the anima1s simu1tane0us1y With the Vaccinati0n and f0r perhaps ab0ut 2 Weeks thereafter. Orthomyx0Viruses and paramyx0Viruses are a subclass of the ear1ier co11ectiVe designation for inﬂuenza Viruses and 0ther simi1ar Viruses. ln humans , the paramyx0Viruses cause meas1es , mumps , and respirat0ry and neur010gic diseases. The paramyxoViruses include , am0ng others , parainﬂuenza Virus , mumps Virus , NeWcastle disease Virus , respiratory syncytial Virus ( RSV ) , meas1es Virus , and rinderpest Virus. The inﬂuenza A , B and C Viruses , Which cause ﬂu in humans , are members 0f the orth0myx0Viruses. The type A inﬂuenza Viruses are resp0nsible for m0st of the ﬂu epidemics and a11 the pandemics. lnﬂuenza A Viruses do occur in horses and pigs as We1l as in birds , such as the path0gens of the c1assica1 aVian pseud0p1ague [ NeWcast1e disease ] ; hoWeVer , 0n1y the human inﬂuenza Viruses and th0se 0f mammals , such as the horse , can be 00nsidered respiratory Viruses in the true sense , as the biol0gy of the aVian inﬂuenza Virus ( Al ) diﬂers c0mp1etely from that of the human inﬂuenza Virus. Therefore , the Al Virus cann0t be considered a respirat0ry Virus. ln ducks , the Virus replicates , primari1y , in the intestina1 tract ; yet this is n0t the case in humans. As a resu1t , Al Viruses can a1so be iso1ated from feces of birds ( HinshaW et al. , 1980 , Canad. J. Micr0bio1. US 7 , 282 , 599 B2. 9. 26 , 622 - 9 ) . ln addition t0 that , the nucle0tide Variation rate of Al Viruses is 10Wer than th0se of the Viruses that can be is01ated from mamma1s. EVoluti0n of the Vira1 proteins in 0rganisms 0ther than birds , typica11y , exhibits rapid accumulati0n 0f mutations , Which d0 n0t occur in the Al Viruses ( G0rman et a1. , 1991 , J. V1rol. 65 : 3704 - 14 ; LudWig et a1. , 1995 , Viro1ogy 212 : 555 - 61 ) . The receptor speciﬁcity Varies am0ng diiferent inﬂuenza Viruses. Most of the Al Viruses preferably bind t0 the a1pha - 2 - 3 - ga1act0se - sia1ic acid receptor. ln 00ntrast , human inﬂuenza Viruses bind primari1y to the a1pha - 2 - 6 - galact0se - sia1ic acid recept0r ( R0gers and Pau1s0n , 1983 , Viro1ogy l27 , 361 - 73 ; Baum and Paulson , 1990 , Acta Histochem. , Supp1. 40 : 35 - 8 ) . As the Viruses c0Vered by the inVention cause many Widespread diseases in humans and mammals , the antiVira1 action 0f the dithiocarbamate c0mpounds according t0 the inVention is particularly imp0rtant With respect t0 th0se Viruses. As the dithiocarbamate c0mpounds according to the inVention are 0utstanding1y actiVe against those Viruses , the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate compounds are particularly suitable for pr0ducti0n 0f a series 0f agents t0 treat or preVent those Virus infections. The dithiocarbamate c0mpounds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n can be pr0duced easi1y and cost - eﬂectiVe1y in 1arge quantities , and they are scarce1y toxic to the cel1s being treated , eVen at high 00ncentrati0ns. ln 0ne adVantageous emb0diment , the dithi0carbamate compounds acc0rding t0 the inVention are proVided in the agent at a 00ncentrati0n 0f fr0m 0.01 t0 5000 mM , prefer - ab1y , 1 to 300 mM , and , especia11y preferab1y , 10 to 100 mM. The dithi0carbamate 00mp0unds according t0 the inVention are particularly actiVe against respiratory RNA Virus infections at these concentrations and exhibit feW or no side effects. The c0ncentrati0n to be used is se1ected acc0rding t0 the Virus infecti0n to be treated , depending on the intensity of the Virus infecti0n , 0r acc0rding t0 the 0rganism t0 be treated , Whether animal or human , and depending on the age. lt is particularly suitable to proVide the dithi0carbamate c0mp0unds acc0rding to the inVenti0n at a concentrati0n 0f fr0m 10 mM t0 1 M. ln this case , the dithi0carbamate c0mpounds according t0 the inVenti0n are present in highly concentrated form , and the agent can be diluted before treatment , depending 0n the c0ncentrati0n desired. The agent preferab1y further c0mprises a pharmaceuti - ca11y acceptab1e carrier. Any 0f the pharmaceutica11y acceptable carriers kn0Wn t0 th0se skilled in the art 0f pharmacy can be used , such as ph0sphate - buﬂered saline solution ( PBS ) 0r sodium ch1oride so1utions With diﬂerent buﬂers , or f0rmu1ati0ns c0ntaining 11p0s0mes , in Which case , again , the carrier is se1ected depending 0n the type 0f treatment , the Virus infecti0n , and the 0rganism being treated. The agent is preferably 0ne that is administered orally , intranasa1ly , intraVenously , parentera11y , recta1ly , as eye or ear dr0ps , a garg1e , 0r an aeros01. The m0de 0f administra - ti0n especia1ly depends 0n the Virus infection being treated. For example , an infection in the respirat0ry tract is treated With an agent t0 be administered intranasal1y , such as in the form of an aer0so1 c0mprising the dithi0carbamate com - p0unds , because the Virus infecti0n is treated right at the site 0f the Virus attack. Depending on the m0de 0f administration , the dithiocarbamate c0mp0unds are proVided at a particular concentration , 0r the agent inc1udes additi0na1 substances faVorable for that form of administration. lt is 0bVious1y possib1e to pr0Vide the agent in a dried f0rm , in Which case it is di1uted With a suitab1e s0lVent bef0re the treatment. One particular1y adVantage0us use is if the agent comprises further antiVira1 substances. ln this Way , the Virus. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 10. infecti0n in the respiratory tract can be attacked fr0m seVera1 sides , or a Wh01e range of diiferent Viruses can be Weakened or comp1etely eliminated at the same time. Such further antiVira1 substances inc1ude substances inhibiting rep1ica - ti0n , immune - stimulating substances , neutra1izing antib0d - ies , etc. as We1l as 0pti0nal1y substances that can supp0rt the immune system genera11y. Preferab1y , the agent comprises a c0mbination 0f at 1east tW0 diﬂerent dithiocarbamates according to the inVention , particular1y a mixture 0f PDTC and DDTC. The dithi0carbamate compounds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n exert pr0 - oxidatiVe and anti - oxidatiVe functions in ce11s. Their antioxidatiVe acti0n includes e1imination 0f hydrogen peroxide , rem0Va1 of super0xide radica1s , peroxynitrites , hydr0xy1 radica1s , and 11pid peroxidati0n pr0ducts. By these e1iminations , the dithiocarbamates are oxidized to thiuram disul - ﬁdes. Thiuram disu1ﬁdes are resp0nsib1e for the pro - 0xidatiVe actions of dithi0carbamates , and , in many cases , the formati0n of thiurams depends 0n the presence 0f metals. 11 has been rep0rted that , perhaps , the anti - ap0ptotic actiVities of dithi0carbamates are related t0 inactiVati0n 0f caspases by thio1 0xidation. lt is particu1ar1y preferred f0r the agent acc0rding t0 the inVention t0 further 00mprise substances selected from antibiotics , Vaccines , immune - suppressants , stabi1izers , immune - stimulating substances , blood pr0ducts , 0r mixtures thereof. lf additi0na1 antibiotics are used , bacteria1 infections can be c0mbatted a10ng With the respirat0ry Viruses. lf the agent c0mprises additiona1 Vaccines , understood here to mean b0th pas siVe and actiVe Vaccines , certain other , further Virus infections that can easily infect the Weakened organism are preVented at the same time as the inVentiVe treatment or preVenti0n 0f the Virus infecti0n. ln additi0n , stabi1izers can a1s0 be added to increase the st0rage stabi1ity or 1ifetime. Bl00d products , f0r example , are plasma , blo0d c0rpuscles , cl0tting fact0rs , etc. , depending 0n the treatment to Which the patient is subjected. lt is suitab1e t0 use the agent t0 inhibit Virus pr0pagati0n. ln that manner it is ensured that an existing infecti0n d0es n0t spread , but , in 00ntrast , is treated Very quickly. According t0 a further aspect of the present inVention , the inVenti0n a1s0 c0ncerns a disinfectant c0mprising at 1east 0ne inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mp0und as described ab0Ve. ln this inVenti0n , “disinfectant” means any substance used outside a human 0r animal 0rganism to c0mbat Viruses , as on surfaces , in agents , especially in media , or for cell cu1tures. ln particu1ar , such disinfectants can be used if the substance t0 be treated is sensitiVe t0 0ther m0re aggressiVe antiVira1 substances. F0r instance , disinfectants c0mprising the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate c0mpounds are suitable as additiVes t0 media or for treating cells or cell cultures Which react sensitiVe1y t0 other more aggressiVe disinfectants or antiVira1 substances. The dithiocarbamate c0mp0unds according to the inVenti0n haVe shoWn themse1Ves t0 be particularly eﬂectiVe in treatment 0r preVenti0n 0f respiratory RNA Virus infections 0f respiratory ce11s and cel1 cu1tures. The disinfectant is particu1ar1y effectiVe if it c0mprises the dithiocarbamate c0mp0unds acc0rding t0 the inVention at a concentration 0f fr0m 10 um t0 5 M , in particular 30 um t0 1 M. These concentrations , on one hand , are actiVe against respiratory RNA Virus infections and , on the 0ther hand , such a disinfectant is 0utstanding1y gent1e , for examp1e , if it is used as an antiViral substance for cel1 cultures. Here , the concentration depends 0n the nature 0r 0n the adVanced stage of the Virus infection , and on the substance used for treatment , for instance , on the nature and sensitiVity of the. US 7 , 282 , 599 B2. 11. ce11s. ObViously , it is a1s0 p0ssible t0 proVide the disinfectant as a concentrate , in Which case it is di1uted bef0re use to the desired c0ncentration of the dithi0carbamate c0m - p0unds acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n , using a suitab1e so1Vent. The disinfectant preferab1y comprises further disinfecting , in particular antiVira1 , substances. These substances , knoWn to anyone skil1ed in the art in the ﬁeld of micr0biology , are added particu1arly if 0ther Viruses are t0 be combatted at the same time , such as DNA Viruses. ObVi - 0us1y , furthermore antibacteria1 substances , especia1ly anti - bi0tics , can als0 be added. A further aspect 0f the present inVention concerns a process for disinfecting surfaces , media 0r ce11 cu1tures , Wherein a disinfectant acc0rding to the inVention , such as is described ab0Ve , is app1ied t0 the surface or cel1 cu1ture , 0r is added t0 the medium , respectiVely. T0 disinfect a surface , f0r instance , it is suﬂicient t0 c1ean the surface With the disinfectant. ln the case 0f media and ce1l cu1tures , the disinfectant can exert its action 0Ver longer periods , and the concentrati0n of the disinfectant can be Varied as described aboVe , depending 0n the respectiVe purp0se. Acc0rding t0 another aspect of the present inVention , the inVenti0n c0ncerns treatment 0r preVenti0n 0f a respirat0ry RNA Virus infecti0n With the inVentiVe dithi0carbamate compounds. Here , an agent comprising the inVentiVe dithi0 - carbamate c0mp0unds as described ab0Ve is administered , in a suitab1e form and at a suitab1e concentration , to the patient 0r anima1. The present inVenti0n Wi11 n0W be exp1ained in m0re detail by means of the acc0mpanying examples and ﬁgures , but it is not limited t0 them.

PDTC Was added after infection of ce1ls With Vari0us HRV ser0types to test the eﬂectiVeness during infecti0ns by HRV. HeLa cells Were infected With HRV ser0types 1A , 2 , l4 and l6 With 20 TClD50 ( tissue cu1ture infectious dose 50 ) per ce11. PDTC Was added at the same time to a concentra - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 12. ti0n 0f 125 um in the medium. Excess Virus Was rem0Ved 4 hours after infection , While PDTC Was added t0 the fresh medium. 24 h0urs ( FlG. 1 , top ) and 48 hours ( FlG. 1 , b0tt0m ) after the infecti0n ( p. l. ) , the supernatants Were col1ected and the am0unt of Virus progeny Was determined by TClD50 tests. Treatment 0f ce11s With PDTC reduced the Virus titer ( Vt ) by 103 after 24 hours ( FlG. 1 , top ) . The supernatants collected from PDTC - treated cells 48 hours after infection a1s0 sh0Wed a signiﬁcant reduction of the Virus titer ( FlG. 1 , b0tt0m ) . These tests shoW that PDTC has strong anti - Viral action against Vari0us HRV ser0types. Examp1e 2. PDTC lnhibits HRV - induced Cyt0pathic Eifects and lncreases the Viabi1ity of lnfected Ce11s. Morphol0gical changes in the ce1ls , ca11ed “cytopathic eﬂects” ( CPE ) 0ccur in the late stages 0f a rhinoViral infection. These HRV induced CPE are characterized as cel1 rounding , shrinkage , deformation of the nuc1eus and chromatin 00ndensati0n. When HeLa cel1s are infected With HRV2 , HRV14 , HRV1A and HRV16 at 100 TClD50 per ce11 , a distinct cytopathic eﬂect is Visible after 8 hours postinfection. Addition of PDTC during the infection preVents the appearance 0f these cyt0pathic effects. FlG. 2 sh0Ws that the morph01ogy of ce11s infected in the presence 0f 125 uM PDTC ( see the 10Wer right ﬁgure ) cannot be distinguished fr0m the m0rphol0gy 0f non - infected ( n. i. ) cells 8 hours after the infection ( see the tWo upper ﬁgures ) . Thus , the PDTC treatment attacks the Virus infecti0n at a Very ear1y stage , s0 that m0re extensiVe ce11 damage is preVented. Example 3. lncrease 0f V1ability 0f lnfected Cells by PDTC and DDTC. A ce11 pr01iferati0n assay Was d0ne t0 test the effect 0f PDTC 0r DDTC 0n the Viabi1ity 0f the ce11s during a Vira1 infecti0n. A Cell Titer 96® AqueWS N0n - radioactiVe Cell Pr0liferation Assay ( Pr0mega ; Madison , Wis. , U. S. A. ) Was done according to the manufacturers instructions. Ce1ls Were p1aced in 96 We11 p1ates 0ne day bef0re the infecti0n. These ce11s Were infected With Vari0us HRV ser0types at 20 TClD50 / cell. The Viability 0f the cells Was determined by addition 0f a tetraz0lium substance , incubation f0r 2 hours at 370 C. , and measurement of the absorption at 492 nm. TWenty - f0ur h0urs after infecti0n With HRV2 , HeLa ce11s sh0Wed c0mp1ete 10ss 0f their metab01ic actiVity , 00mpared With n0ninfected HeLa cells ( m0ck infecti0n medium : MlM ) . lt can be seen in FlG. 3 ( Top : DDTC ; bottom : PDTC ) that the Viability of the cells is signiﬁcant1y increased by adding eVen s1ight c0ncentrati0ns 0f PDTC 0r DDTC. PDTC 0r DDTC a10ne has 0n1y minor eﬂects on uninfected ce11s. The c0ncentrati0n used t0 inhibit the Vira1 infecti0ns exhibits n0 t0xicity , th0ugh ( “ - ” means “Without” ) . Examp1e 4. Dependence of the Eﬂicacy of PDTC on the Time [ 0f Administrati0n ] . To determine the stage 0f the Viral life cyc1e attacked by PDTC , PDTC Was added at Vari0us times f0110Wing Virus infection With 20 TClD50 per cel1 , and pr0liferation assays. US 7 , 282 , 599 B2. 13. Were done. lt Was sh0Wn that additi0n 0f PDTC ( 125 uM ) Within the ﬁrst six hours after infecti0n ( “ - ” means “Without” ) oifers the best pr0tection against Virus induced 10ss of pr01iferation ( FlG. 4A ) . This eifect is a1s0 n0t speciﬁc f0r a sing1e serotype , as HRC ser0types 1A , 2 , 14 and 16 Were used. On1y PDTC treatment ( 125 uM ) 0f the cells m0re than 8 hours after infection reduced the protectiVe eﬂect. Simi1ar resu1ts Were obtained if the Vira1 titers ( Vt ) Were determined in the supernatants of infected and PDTC - treated ce11s ( see FlG. 4B ) . Additi0n of PDTC up to four h0urs after infecti0n reduced the titer of the HRV2 produced by 103. EVen if the PDTC treatment Was started 0n1y 6 hours after infection , the Vira1 titers produced Were signiﬁcant1y reduced. These results shoW that additi0n of PDTC has an antiViral effect eVen When it is done at 1ater stages during the infection , and that the Viabi1ity of the ce11s is increased Whi1e the amount of infectious Viruses is dramatically reduced. This shoWs that the antiViral action does n0t 0ccur just in the ear1y stages of the Vira1 11fe cyc1e , such as during recept0r binding or entry int0 the ce1l. Example 5. anestigati0n 0f the C0urse 0f HRV lnfecti0n in the Presence of PDTC. Vari0us proteolytic actiVities Were determined t0 examine the course of a rhin0Vira1 infecti0n in the presence and absence 0f PDTC. Enzymatic sp1itting 0f the ce11u1ar translati0n initiation factors 4Gl ( elF4Gl ) and 4Gll by Viral 2A protease , ending h0st cell protein synthesis , is 0ne characteristic pr0te01ytic actiVity that 00curs in the 00urse 0f infection With rhin0Viruses and enter0Viruses. Depending 0n the HRV ser0type , elF4G pr0teins are split in an early stage of infecti0n. An0ther splitting actiVity during a rhinoViral infecti0n , 0n1y recent1y described , is sp1itting 0f the intermediary ﬁ1ament pr0tein cyt0keratin 8. This sp1itting a1s0 depends on the 2A pr0tease , but 0ccurs at a later stage 0f the infection. ln order t0 inVestigate the effect 0f a PDTC treatment 0n the c0urse 0f a Virus infecti0n , a Western b10t ana1ysis Was d0ne t0 ana1yze these 2A pr0tease substrates. Medium Was remoVed at the indicated times f0r the Western bl0t analysis. The cells Were lysed by adding 100 ul 0f pr0tein buffer ( 8% s0dium d0decy1 su1fate , 20% B - mercapt0 - ethan01 , 20% g1ycer01 , 0.04% br0mphen01b1ue ) . 20 u1 protein extract Was separated by SDS - PAGE 0n each track , and b10tted 0nto PVDF membranes. The incubation With antibodies Was d0ne With 0.1% TWeen 20 and 5% skim mi1k poWder in TBS. Po1yc1ona1 rabbit antibodies to elF4Gl Were used for the immunodetecti0n. Anti - rabbit immun0gl0bu1ins c0njugated With a1ka1ine ph0sphatase Were used as the sec0ndary antib0dies. Staining Was d0ne With the a1ka1ine phosphatase reaction. The molecu1ar Weights Were determined by using a prestained SDS - 7B marker ( Sigma ) . Sp1itting of elF4Gl can be detected 4 hours after infection in HeLa ce11s infected With HRV2 ( 100 TClD50 per ce11 ) . ( cp stands for sp1itting product , “cleaVage pr0duct” ) . Sp1itting is c0mplete 8 h0urs after infecti0n ( FlG. 5 ) . No splitting of elF4Gl can be detected at those times in infected cel1s in the presence 0f PDTC. At 1ater times , ab0ut 24 h0urs after infection , slight elF4Gl sp1itting can be detected eVen in ce11s treated With PDTC. This shoWs that either the protease function is b1ocked , or that the am0unt 0f Viral pr0teins is great1y reduced. Example 6. Detection of Vira1 EnVelope Pr0teins To determine the eﬂect of PDTC 0n the expression 0f Viral proteins , capsid proteins of HRV2 Were detected by. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 14. Western bl0t ana1ysis in pr0tein extracts from HRV2 - infected HeLa cel1s ( 100 TClD50 per ce1l ) ( see FlG. 6 ) . The Western b10t analysis Was done as described ab0Ve in Examp1e 5 , With use 0f a p01yc10na1 rabbit antiserum against HRV2. Signiﬁcant amounts of the rhinoVira1 pr0teins VP1 , VP2 and VP3 Were detected in untreated cel1s six h0urs after infection. A PDTC treatment preVented expressi0n 0f those capsid proteins Within the ﬁrst 8 hours after infection. Weak expression of VP1 , VP2 and VP3 Was detected 0n1y at a 1ater time , ab0ut 24 hours after infecti0n. This sh0Ws that PDTC de1ays production of Vira1 pr0teins , exp1aining the anti - rhinoVira1 acti0n of PDTC as We11 as its protectiVe action 0n ce1ls. Examp1e 7. Detennination 0f the Dependence of the AntiVira1 Action on the Redox P0tentia1. Other antioxidants Were tested f0r their inhibitory acti0n during a HRV2 infection 0f HeLa cells ( FlG. 7 ) . HeLa cells Were infected With HRV2 ( 100 TClD50 per ce1l ) in a 6 Wel1 plate ( “n. i.” means “not infected” ) . The medium Was rem0Ved 1 hour after the infection , and fresh medium , 0r media With Vari0us c0ncentrations of PDTC or NAC , Was added. After 24 hours , the cell laWn Was Washed With PBS and stained With crysta1Vi0let. lt is apparent in FlG. 7A that the infection With HRV2 destroys the ce11 1aWn. PDTC , but not NAC , can preVent that e1fect. The eﬂicacies of Vitamin C , Trolox , and B - mercaptoethanol ( 2 - ME ) Were determined as described in Examp1e 3 ( FlGS. 7B , C , D ) . lt Was sh0Wn , surprising1y , that n0ne 0f these anti0xidants had any pr0tectiVe eﬂect during Viral pr0liferation. The toxic eﬂects 0f the substances in the absence of Virus Were tested as controls. A high dose 0f Vitamin C ( 100 ug / ml ) seVerely inhibits cell gr0Wth. This sh0Ws that the antiVira1 acti0n 0f PDTC is n0t due t0 its anti0xidatiVe acti0n , but is apparent1y re1ated t0 0ther properties. Example 8. Action of PDTC 0n lnﬂuenza Virus Rep1icati0n. 5><l05 Vero cel1s Were infected With inﬂuenza Virus A / PR8 / 34 0r V1enna / 47 / 96 , With an m. 0. i. ( mu1tip1icity 0f infecti0n ) 0f 0.01 and incubated f0r 1 h0ur at r00m temperature. Then , the in0culum Was rem0Ved and infecti0n medium containing 5 ug / ml trypsin and 600 uM PDTC Were added. The supernatants Were remoVed after 48 and 72 h0urs , and the Virus titers in the supernatants Were determined by a standard p1ate assay. As sh0Wn in FlG. 8 , the Virus titer fr0m A / PR8 / 34 Was reduced by m0re than 2 log steps , compared With the control sample ( c ) . To test the eﬂicacy of the PDTC , a TClD50 ( 50% tissue - cu1ture - infectiVe dose ) assay Was done With and Without PDTC. TClD50 Was ca1cu1ated at each c0ncentrati0n by the meth0d 0f Kaerber : 96 Well micr0titer plates Were infected With tW0 - f0ld diluti0ns of the speciﬁed Virus. One h0ur after the infection , the supernatant Was remoVed and media containing the speciﬁed concentrations Were added. The numbers of infected ce1ls Were determined after 4 days. FlG. 9 shoWs that the TClD50 Was reduced by 76.4% and 82.2% , respectiVe1y , for A / PR8 / 34 and A / Vienna / 47 / 96 at a PDTC concentration of 300 uM. M0re than 99.9% inhibition Was attained for both Viruses at a c0ncentration 0f 1200 uM. US 7 , 282 , 599 B2. 15 Examp1e 9. Determination 0f the EﬂectiVe C0ncentrati0n 0f PDTC. The eifectiVe concentration of PDTC Was determined using a CPE ( cytopathic eifect ) reducti0n assay. Ver0 ce1ls Were cultiVated in 96 We11micr0titer p1ates and infected With 5 TClD50 per We1l and 50 TClD50 per We11 0f inﬂuenza A / PR8 / 34 and With 5 TClD50 per We1l 0f inﬂuenza A / V1 - enna / 47 / 96. The supernatants Were rem0Ved 1 h0ur after infection , and medium With 5 ug / ml trypsin and a 2 - f01d dilution series 0f PDTC beginning at a concentration 0f 1200 uM Was added. The plates at each c0ncentrati0n Were examined Visually f0r cyt0pathic effects With respect t0 the c0ntr01 sample 0Ver the f0l10Wing 4 days. The occurrence 0f cyt0pathic eﬂects With respect to the c0ntro1 samp1e Was ca1culated for each concentrati0n. 100% positiVe means c0mp1ete1ysis in all We1ls. lt can be seen in FlG. 10 that 50% reducti0n 0f p0sitiVe Wells Was attained at PDTC c0ncentrati0ns betWeen 50 and 100 uM. C0mp1ete inhibition 0f cyt0pathic eifects Was attained at a PDTC concentration of 600 uM for a11 Viruses. Example 10. Determinati0n 0f the PDTC Acti0n ln ViV0. Ten C57 / BL6 mice Were in0cu1ated intranasa1ly With a 1etha1 d0 se ( 50 til 107 pr ) . One h0ur1ater , they Were treated intranasally With 25 id 600 mM PDTC 0r With 25 111 PBS. The mice Were examined and treated eVery 12 hours f0r the ﬁrst 48 hours and then eVery 24 h0urs. The Weights 0f the mice Were determined and rep0rted in % 0f the initia1 Weight ( % W ) ( FlG. 11A ) . FlG. 11B sh0Ws that a11 the mice treated With PDTC ( squares ) surViVed the Virus infecti0n and gained Weight 7 days after the infecti0n. All the mice treated With PBS ( diam0nds ) died Within 12 days after the infection ( % s : % surViVing ) . This sh0Ws that PDTC a10ne exhibits str0ng actiVity against inﬂuenza Virus infections in Vitr0 and in Vitr0. Examp1e 11. AntiVira1ActiVity 0f PDTC Against Equine Rhinitis AVirus ( ERAV ) . The reducti0n 0f ERAV Vira1 pr0pagati0n by additi0n 0f PDTC Was inVestigated as f0110Ws : Ver0 ce1ls Were infected With 10 TClD50 ERAV per cell. At the same time , PDTC Was added at diﬂerent c0ncentrations ( 1 mM - 50 uM ) . The inocu - 1um Was rem0Ved 4 h0urs after infecti0n , and fresh medium With PDTC Was added. The supernatants Were rem0Ved 24 h0urs after the infecti0n , and the Vira1 titers Were determined in a standard plate assay. FlG. 12 sh0Ws that the Virus titer ( Vt ) in the supernatant decreases in comparison t0 untreated cel1s ( - ) . Examp1e 12. Eﬂect 0f PDTC 0n Pr01iferati0n 0f F00t and M0uth Disease Virus ( FMV ) in Cel1 Culture. The concentration 0f PDTC eﬂectiVe against ce11 destruc - ti0n caused by FMV Virus Was determined by a CPE ( cyt0pathic effect ) reducti0n assay. lB - RS - 2 ce1ls Were cultiVated in 96 We11micr0titer p1ates , infected With 0.1 TClD50 per ce11 0f FMV Virus O - Manisa , and incubated for l h0ur at 37° C. Then , the inocu1um Was rem0Ved and infection medium With the speciﬁed c0ncen - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 16. trati0ns 0f PDTC ( 10 uM t0 1200 uM ) Was added. The number 0f infected Wells Was determined after 24 hours by micr0sc0pic obserVati0n 0f the cytopathic eifect. FlG. 13A sh0Ws that the number 0f infected We11s ( % p0s. ) after 24 h0urs depends 0n the PDTC 00ncentrati0n. 600 uM PDTC giVes the cel1s 100% pr0tecti0n against the cytopathic eﬂect of the Virus. A 50% reduction of infected We11s Was attained in the concentration range 0f 75 uM to 150 uM. T0 test the acti0n 0f PDTC 0n FMV Virus replicati0n , lB - RS - 2 ce11s in T25 cm2 ce11 culture b0ttles Were infected With FMV Virus O - Manisa at 0.001 TClD50 per cel1 and incubated for 1 h0ur at 37° C. Then , the in0cu1um Was rem0Ved and infecti0n medium containing the speciﬁed c0ncentrati0n 0f PDTC ( 0 uM t0 200 uM ) Was added. The supernatants Were rem0Ved 24 hours after infecti0n and the Vira1 titers ( TClD ) Were determined in a standard p1ate assay. As FlG. 13B sh0Ws , the Virus titer of the O - Manisa FMV Virus Was reduced by more than 2 10g steps by PDTC , compared With the contr01 samp1e ( 0 ) . No PDTC Was added t0 the c0ntr0l sample. Examp1e 13. Acti0n 0f PDTC 0n Pr01iferati0n 0f FSME in Ce11 Cu1ture. FSME Viruses do not be10ng to the picomaViruses and d0 n0t cause respirat0ry tract disease. C0nﬂuent m0n0layers 0f BHK - 21 cells ( ATCC ) Were infected With 10 pfu / cel1 0f FSME Virus ( Neud0rfe1 ) in the presence 0f the f0110Wing c0ncentrati0ns 0f PDTC : 1000 uM , 500 uM , 250 uM , 125 uM , 62.5 uM , 31.25 uM , 15.6 uM , 7.8 uM , 1.95 uM and 0.975 uM. Then the cells Were incubated f0r 4 days at 37° C. , and the ce11 m0n01ayer Was examined micr0sc0pica11y. The Virus pr01iferati0n Was determined using an enzyme immun0assay. The micr0scopic examination sh0Wed no indications 0f t0xic eﬂects 0f PDTC. Quantiﬁcati0n 0f the Virus pr0lifera - ti0n sh0Wed that PDTC cann0t reduce the Virus pr0liferati0n at any 0f the c0ncentrati0ns tested. Simi1ar1y , We inVestigated Whether PDTC can affect Virus pr0liferati0n in suspended ce11s. The same c0ncentrati0ns as ab0Ve Were tested. This test , t00 , sh0Wed n0 indicati0n 0f reducti0n 0f Virus pr0liferati0n by PDTC. Examp1e 14. Acti0n 0f PDTC 0n EMC - infected Mice. C57B16 mice Were infected intraperit0neally With 10 TClD50 0f EMC Virus. Then , the c0ntr0l gr0up Was treated intraperit0nea11y once dai1y With PBS. TWO 0ther groups Were treated With 50 111 0f 50 mM PDTC per day. Treatment 0f 0ne gr0up ( PDTC ) Was started simu1tane0usly With the infecti0n , While treatment 0f the 0ther gr0up ( PDTC 24 hpi ) Was started 0nly 24 h0urs after the infecti0n. FlG. 14 shoWs the changes 0f the mouse Weights after the beginning 0f the infecti0n. lt is apparent that there is n0 diﬂerence in treated and untreated mice. The aVerage time t0 death f0r the infected mice Was 5.5 days in eVery gr0up. This shoWs that PDTC has no eﬂect on an EMC infection. EMC does indeed be1ong to the picoma Viruses , but d0es not cause disease in the respirat0ry tract , but rather in nerVe ce11s. The inVenti0n claimed is : . 1.
