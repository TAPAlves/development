Patented Jan8 , 1918. App1ication ﬁ1ed March 15 , 1917. ' Seria1No.155 , 027. T0 aZZ w7wm it may 00ncern : . Be it known that I , BARNEY L. BUsCH , 1. 1 a citizen of the United States , residing at. 111. - ' _15. Chicago in the c0unty of 000k and State of Illinois , have 1nv ented certain new and useful Improvements in Lighting Systems for Automobi1es , of which the foll0wing is a speciﬁcati0n. This 1n1ention relates to 11ghting systems for automobiles , and more particularly to a. system whereby the head lights of an auto - . m0bile may be connected either 1n series or in muItiple , so as to dim the lights or turn. them 011 with ful1 force , as desired , and a - . specia11y constructed switch for use in c0n - nection with this system. 0ne of the main objects of the invention. - _ is to provide a system or c0ntrol for the head. 30. iights 0f an automobile whereby the lights may be connected to the battery either in series , so as t0 increase the resistance of the. ' circuit and thus dim the 11gh - ts or in multi - . . ple so as to permit the ful1 current to ﬂow. 25 - . 30. through b0th lamps thus turning the lights on ful1 force. A further object 1s to provide a switch f r controlling this system so constructed as to permit the head 1ights of the automobile to be quickly and easily connected to the battery either in series or in multiple , thus eliminating all necessity for resistance coils such as are provided 1n the. . more common forms of light control systems. .35. _ - 40. 45. 50. 65. n0w in use. A further object 1$ to pr0vide a switch 0f the character stated of simple construction and operation and Which may be. ' produced at relatively smal1 cost. Further. objects wi1l appear from the detai1 description. In the drawings : — . Figure 1 is a top plan view of a control switch constructed 1n accordance With my invention , . Fig. 2 : is an underneath view of the same , . Fig. 3 is a section on Iine 3———3 of Fig. 1 , . Fig. 4 is a section on line H of Fig. 1 , . Fig. 5 is a detail of the insulating Washer. ‘ which supports the connecting bar , . Fig. 6 is a diagrammatic view of a light. control system arranged in acc0rdance with _ - . my invention with the contro1 switch 111 position for connecting the head 1ights 1n multiple , and. Fig. 7 is a similar view with the head lights connected 1n series. . ‘. For controlIing the light system I provide a switch of special construction , which is. at the center 0f its outer face , with an inte - . ' 1. A . metal washer 17 is interposed between. shown in Figs. 1 to 5 of the drawings. In constructing this switch I provide a cdisk 1 . of insulating material which is centrally " apertured to 10tatably recei1 e a pivot bolt 2. This bolt 1sﬂattened on one side , as at 2. The pivot bolt 2 1s inserted through a switch handle 3 at the 1nner end thereof , this handle - being provided with an ape1ture which corresponds 1n shape to the cr0ss secti0n of the 65 bolt thus connecting the bo1t to the hand1e . - so as to turn therewith. This handle may. be made 0f resilient sheet meta1 or brass , or . any other suitable electric conducting ma— - terial , and 1s proVided at its outer end with 70 a ﬁnger knob 41. A suitable washer 5 0f 1n - ' sulating material is interposed betwecn the . switch handle and disk 1 so as to prevent . wear of the disk. At the underside of thedisk a hea1y washer 6 is mounted about the b0lt 2 and is proVided with a central bore corresponding in cross section to the _c_ross scction of - the bolt so that this washer 13 rotated with the bolt. Washer 6 is provided , . 60. 75. 80 gra1 raised portion of polygonal shape in cr 0ss section which . provides 1n eﬂ ' ect a nut 7 A resilient connecting bar 8 is mounted about this nut , being provided at its center 11itl1 an opening 1111ich snugly 1cte11 es the nut. By this means the connecting bar or. ' 85. arm 8 is Yconnected to the boit 2 so as to be. rotated when the bolt is rotated , but iseffectually insulated electrica1ly from the - . bolt. A nut 9 is threaded on the lower end - 90 ' . ' of bolt 2 , a suitable washer 10 of insu1ating. material being interposed betn een this nut and the mm 8 The axis of ba1 8 , w - hich bar 1s made of resilient brass , or other s111t - - _ able electric conducting material , is disposed - 95 - . in - a plane at right ang1es to the axis of the . switch arm 3. Three head contact. screws 11. 12 and 13 are inserted through disk 1. These screws are all disposed concentric with the pivot 100 bolt 2 , and are equi— —distant thcrefrom. The - " screws 11 and 13 are disposed diametrica1ly . . opposite each other on the disk and the screw — 12 13 positioned mid - - way between screws 11 and 13 , so that the heads of these three screws are contained within an arc ' of 180°. 105. . and are spaced 90° apart. Thumb . - nuts 14 , . 15 and 16 , are threaded on the screws 11 , 15 and 12 , respectively , underneath the disk ' 110. each thumbnut and the disk. These thumb nuts and washers provide means whereby a. 16. 15. 20. 25. 36. 35. Q. wire may be electrically connected toeach of the contact screws. The switch handle 3 is provided on its under face with an integral rounded bossor ' contact member 18. This member is so ' disposed that , when the switch handle is rotated , it will contact with the heads ot the contact screws. By turning switch handle 3 in the proper direction , . the two contact screws 11 and 13 - may be electrically connected by means or the arm. .8 , or the switch arm 3 may be electrically. connected to either oi the screws 11 and 1.3 , as desired. _ _. _Referring more particularly to Figs. 6 and 7 of the drawings , the positive side o£ an electric battery 19 is connected by a lead 20 to the switch handle 3 , this lead being secured between the head 2b of the ' pivot bolt 2 and the inner end of the switch handle. T he negative side oi battery 19 is connected by wire 21 to the head light 22 of the automobile , which is connected by wire 23 to the other head 1ight 2i. Head light 24 is connected by a wire 25 to the contact screw 11. Contact screw 12 is connected by a lead 26 to wire 23 intermediate the head lights , and contact screw 13 is connected by a lead 27 to the wire 21 intermediate battery 19 and head light 22. By turning the switch handle 3 into the posi~ tion shown in Fig. ' 6 of the drawings , the. two contact screws 11 and 13 will be elec~ - . trical1y connected through the contact bar 8 , and the positive side of battery 19 will be connected. to lead 26 through switch handle 3 and contact screw 12. With the switch in this position , a current will ﬁow from the positive side of the battery through lead. - 26 to wire 23. This current will divide at. _46. 45. the point of junction between lead 26 and wire 23 , part of the current flowing through. 7 head light 22 and wire 21 to . the negative. side ofthe battery. The other part of the. . current will flow through head light 2t , . wire .25 , contact screw 11 , contact. arm 8 , and contact 13 , lead 2? , and a portion ot wire 21 to the negative "side ofthe battery. By this means , the lights are connected in. ' multiple t0 the battery . so that the current. 56. passes through each light at full power thus. insurmg a mammum of illuminating power from the lights. By turning the switch into the position shown in Fig. 7 of the drawings , the current will ﬂow trom the positive. neeanaa _. I side of the battery through lead 20 , switch. handle 3 and contact screw 11 , wire 25 , head light 24 , wire 23 , head light 22 , and wire 21 to the negative side of the battery. By this means the head 1ights are connected in series with the battery , thus opposing twice the resistance to the passage of the current which ‘results in material1y reducing the ﬂow of current through the lights thus dim - . ming the lights. By means of the specially. constructed switch ' which I provide , the. ' lights may be quickly_and easily connectcd. to the battery either 1n multiple or in series , as desired , thus rendering it possible t0 either dim the lights , or turn them on with full force , _by means of a single control switch of simple construction and operation. There may be slight changes Inade in the. construction and arrangement of ' the different parts ot my invention without de~ parting irom the ﬁeld and scope of the same , and l intend to include all such changes , as fall within the appended claim , . 55. 60. 65‘. 70. 75 ' . in this application in which a preferred ' . form only of my invention is . disclosed. "What i claim is : —. In switches , the combination of a disk of insulating material , a pivot bolt rotatably mounted through the center 0f said disk , three headed contact screws secured through said disk concentric with the bolt , a switch handle secured on the bolt above the disk having a downwardly eXtending mcmber adapted to engage the heads 0f the contact screws when the handle is rotated , said con - . tact screws being spa_ced approXimatelv 90°. apart , and ' a connectmg bar carried by the. - ' pivot bolt and connected to said bolt so as. to rotate therewith , said bar being clcctrically insulated from the bolt and of such length as to electrically connect the two diametrically opposite contact screws whcn. 80. dd. 90. 95. the switch handle is moved into a prcde - - . termined position , the aXis of said connecting bar being disposed at right angles to the axis of said switch handle. iii testimony whereof l aflix my signature in presence of two witnesses.
