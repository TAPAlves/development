[ 0004 ] This inVenti0n re1ates t0 meth0ds and c0mp0siti0ns f0r treating 1esi0ns 0f the airWay epithe1ium that can resu1t , f0r eXamp1e , fr0m Vira1 , bacteria1 , and funga1 infecti0ns , inﬂammati0n , a11ergens , inha1ed 0rganic s01Vents , particu - 1ates , 0r irritant gases. BACKGROUND OF THE lNVENTlON. [ 0005 ] externa1nasa1 nares t0 the 1arynx , are caused by a Wide Variety 0f 10ca1 irritants , a11ergens , and infecti0us agents. Typica11y , these irritants giVe rise t0 the sympt0ms 0f rhinitis 0r ‘runny n0se. ln cases 0f seVere 1esi0ns h0WeVer , the tight juncti0ns 0f the respirat0ry epithe1ia1 muc0sa are disrupted such that entry 0f a11ergens 0r infecti0us agents is faci1itated. Upper airWay 1esi0ns , inc1uding 1esi0ns fr0m the. [ 0006 ] Trache0 - br0nchia1 1esi0ns ( trachea and c0nducting br0nchia1 tubes t0 the 1eVe1 0f the respirat0ry br0nchi01es ) are a1s0 00mm0n1y caused by respirat0ry infecti0ns , irritants , and a11ergens. Once the trache0 - br0nchia1 epithe1ium and tight juncti0ns haVe been disrupted , infecti0us , irritant , 0r a11ergic materia1 may sensitize the 1ung , triggering the re1ease 0f mediat0rs , and subsequent airWay c0nstricti0n and asthma. [ 0007 ] The a1Ve01ar epithe1ium , dista1 t0 the respirat0ry br0nchi01es , is genera11y We11 pr0tected against infecti0us , irritant , and a11ergic eXp0sure. HOWeVer , infecti0us , immun0 - 10gic , 0r chemica1 agents that penetrate the deep 1ung structures can cause pneum0nias. lnfecti0us agents that gain access t0 the systemic circu1ati0n in the 10Wer airWay can further resu1t in sepsis pneum0nias 0r a respirat0ry distress syndr0me. M0re0Ver , in certain inﬂammat0ry c0nditi0ns such as asthma , muc0sa1 disrupti0n resu1ts in increased 1eVe1s 0f a11ergens and irritants , such that b0th inﬂammati0n and muc0sa1 1ysis are further exacerbated. [ 0008 ] Rapid rest0rati0n 0f the n0rma1 airWay epithe1ia1 barrier is theref0re critica1 t0 reduce the damage caused by 0ng0ing path0genic 0r a11ergenic mechanisms in respirat0ry tissues and a11eViate the ass0ciated sympt0ms. SUMMARY OF THE 1NVENTlON. [ 0009 ] The present inVenti0n features meth0ds and c0mp0 - siti0ns f0r the treatment 0f 1esi0ns 0f the airWay epithe1ium in mamma1s , by administering t0 the mamma1 therapeutica11y.

Other usefu1 tref0i1 peptides inc1ude p01ypeptides that are substantia11y identica1 t0 SP , pS2 , 1TF , lTF15_73 , 1TF21_73 , 1TF15_72 , 0r lTF21_72. The tref0i1 peptide may be administered as a m0n0mer , a dimer , 0r an0ther mu1timeric f0rm. [ 0010 ] Treatment 0f 1esi0ns acc0rding t0 the inVenti0n can speed hea1ing , reduce pain , de1ay 0r preVent the 0ccurrence 0f the 1esi0n , and inhibit eXpansi0n , sec0ndary infecti0n , 0r 0ther c0mp1icati0ns 0f the 1esi0n. Lesi0ns 0f the airWay epithe1ium may resu1t fr0m any cause , inc1uding f0r examp1e , an a11ergic reacti0n , asthma , an infecti0n , an inha1ed chemica1 0r particu1ate exp0sure , a therma1 1esi0n , sm0ke inha1ati0n , drug - induced1ung damage , trauma ( caused , f0r examp1e , by surgery 0r intubati0n ) , a micr0bia1 infecti0n ( e. g. , bacteria1 , Vira1 , 0r funga1 ) , chr0nic 0b structiVe pu1m0nary disease , anti - ne0p1astic therapy , cystic ﬁbr0sis , cardi0Vascu1ar 00mpr0 - mise such as c0ngestiVe heart fai1ure , 0r hyperbaric 0Xygen therapy. [ 0011 ] 1n an0ther aspect , the inVenti0n pr0Vides a c0mp0 - siti0n , Which inc1udes a tref0i1 peptide in a pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e carrier suitab1e f0r inha1ati0n administrati0n. When f0rmu1ated as such , the c0mp0siti0n may be an aer0s01 ( e. g. , nasa1 spray , inha1ati0n spray , inha1ati0n sO1uti0n , inha - 1ati0n suspensi0n ) administered by a metered d0se inha1er. lf desired , the f0rmu1ati0n c0ntaining the tref0i1 peptide may be nebu1ized ( e. g. , by jet , u1tras0nic nebu1izer , 0r e1ectr0nic nebu1iZer ) . A1tematiVe1y , the tref0i1 peptide f0rmu1ati0n may be administered as a dry p0Wder using a metered d0se inha1er 0r a dry p0Wder inha1er , f0r eXamp1e. [ 0012 ] ln the meth0ds and c0mp0siti0ns 0f this inVenti0n , a sec0nd therapeutic agent can be inc1uded. Such agents inc1ude anti - inﬂammat0ry agents such as g1uc0c0rtic0ids ( bec10methas0ne , ﬂunis01ide , buden0side , triamcin010ne , prednis010ne , deXamethas0ne , 0r fluticas0ne ) 0r n0n - ster0i - da1 anti - inﬂammat0ry agents ( e. g. , ibupr0fen , tacr01imus , cr0m01yn , ned0cr0mi1 , refec0xib , 0r ce1ec0Xib ) ; antimicr0 - bia1 agents ( e. g. , amikacin , gentamicin , kanamycin , ne0mycin , neti1micin , par0m0mycin , strept0mycin , 0r t0bramycin ) ; antihistamines ( e. g. , diphenhydramine , feX0fenadine , cetirizine , 0r 10ratadine ) ; ch01inergic recept0r antag0nists ( e. g. , ipratr0pium br0mide 0r ti0tr0pium ) ; neur01<inin recept0r antag0nists ; 1euk0triene recept0r antag0nists ; dec0ngestants ; ph0sph0diesterase inhibit0rs ; 0r beta - adrenergic recept0r antag0nists ( a1buter01 , bit01ter01 , epinephrine , fen0ter01 , f0r - m0ter01 , is0etharine , is0pr0teren01 , metapr0teren01 , pirbuter01 , pr0cater01 , racepinephrine , sa1meter01 , 0r terbuta - 1ine ) . The sec0nd therapeutic agent may be administered Within ( either bef0re 0r after ) 14 days , 7 days , 1 day , 12 h0urs , 1 h0ur , 0r simu1tane0us1y With the tref0i1 peptide. [ 0013 ] The sec0nd therapeutic agent can be present in the same 0r different pharmaceutica1 c0mp0siti0n as the tref0i1 peptide. When the sec0nd therapeutic agent is present in a different pharmaceutica1 c0mp0siti0n , different r0utes 0f administrati0n may be used. F0r eXamp1e , the sec0nd therapeutic agent may be administered 0ra11y , 0r by intraVen0us , intramuscu1ar , 0r subcutane0us injecti0n. Thus , the sec0nd therapeutic agent need n0t be administered by inha1ati0n. [ 0014 ] Of c0urse , pharmaceutica1 c0mp0siti0ns may c0n - tain tW0 , three , 0r m0re bi010gica11y actiVe tref0i1 peptides.

Such f0rmu1ati0ns are intended f0r de1iVery t0 the respirat0ry airWays by inspirati0n. Typica11y , metered - d0se aer0s01 inha1ers create dr0p1ets that are 20 t0 30 micr0ns in diameter. [ 0039 ] A maj0r 1imitati0n 0f pu1m0nary de1iVery is the difﬁcu1ty 0f reaching the deep 1ung. T0 achieVe high c0ncentrati0ns 0f a tref0i1 peptide s01uti0n in b0th the upper and 10Wer respirat0ry airWays , the tref0i1 peptide is preferab1y nebu1ized in jet nebu1izers , a u1tras0nic nebu1izer , 0r an e1ec - tr0nic nebu1izer particu1ar1y th0se m0diﬁed With the additi0n 0f 0ne - Way ﬁ0W Va1Ves , such as f0r examp1e , the Pari LC P1usTM nebu1izer , c0mmercia11y aVai1ab1e fr0m Pari Respira - t0ry Equipment , lnc. , Richm0nd , Va. , Which de1iVers up t0 20% m0re drug than 0ther unm0diﬁed nebu1izers. [ 0040 ] The pH 0f the f0rmu1ati0n is a1s0 imp0rtant f0r aer0s01 de1iVery. When the aer0s01 is acidic 0r basic , it can cause br0nch0spasm and c0ugh. The safe range 0f pH is re1atiVe and depends 0n a patients t01erance. Some patients t01erate a mi1d1y acidic aer0s01 , Which in 0thers Wi11 cause br0nch0spasm. Typica11y , an aer0s01 s01uti0n haVing a pH 1ess than 4.5 induces br0nch0 spasm. An aer0s01 s01uti0n haVing pH betWeen 4.5 and 5.5 Wi11 0ccasi0na11y cause this pr0b1em. The aer0s01 so1uti0n haVing a pH betWeen 5.5 and 7.0 is usua11y c0nsidered safe. Any aer0s01 haVing pH greater. US 2009 / 0227511 A1. than 7.0 is to be aVoided as the body tissues are unab1e to buffer a1ka1ine aer0s01s and resu1t in irritation and br0nch0 - spasm. Theref0re , the pH 0f the f0rmu1ation is preferab1y maintained betWeen 5 .5 and 7 .0 , mo st preferab1y betWeen 5 . 5 and 6.5 to permit generation of a trefoi1 peptide aeroso1 We11 to1erated by patients Without any secondary undesirab1e side effects such as br0nch0spasm and cough. The 0smo1arity 0f the formu1ati0n can a1s0 be adjusted to 05mo1arities of about 250 to 350 mosm / L , according to the patients to1erance. The administration of a hypertonic or a hypotonic so1ution may be poor1y to1erated in certain instances , particu1ar1y When administered t0 a denuded mucosa. Pr0pe11ants , such as HFA 134a , HFA 227 , or combinations thereof , may a1so be used in the formu1ation. lf desired , excipients that promote drug dispersion or enhance Va1Ve 1ubrication may a1so be formu1ated With the trefoi1 peptide. [ 0041 ] Dry PoWder Formu1ation. [ 0042 ] As an a1ternatiVe therapy t0 aeroso1 de1iVery , the trefoi1 peptide may a1so be administered in a dry poWder formu1ation for efﬁcacious de1iVery into the endobronchia1 space. Such formu1ations haVe seVera1 adVantages , inc1uding product and formu1ation stabi1ity , high drug Vo1ume de1iVery per puff , and 10W susceptibi1ity to micr0bia1 grthh. Therefore , dry poWder inha1ation and metered dose inha1ation are most practica1 When high amounts of trefoi1 peptide need to be de1iVered , inc1uding for examp1e cases in Which a 18rge portion of the respiratory epithe1ium is affected With 1esions. Depending on the efﬁciency of the dry poWder de1iVery deVice , effectiVe dry poWder dosage 1eVe1s typica11y fa11 in the range of about 20 to about 60 mg. The inVention therefore proVides a sufﬁcient1y potent formu1ation of a trefoi1 peptide in dry poWder or metered dose form of drug partic1es. Such a formu1ation is conVenient because it does not require any further hand1ing such as di1uting the dry poWder. Furthermore , it uti1izes deVices that are sufﬁcient1y sma11 , fu11y portab1e and tend to haVe a 10ng she1f1ife. [ 0043 ] For dry poWder formu1ations of the inVention , a trefoi1 peptide composition is mi11ed to a poWder haVing mass median aerodynamic diameters ranging from 1 - 10 microns by media mi11ing , jet mi11ing , spray drying , super - critica1 ﬁuid energy , or partic1e precipitation techniques. [ 0044 ] Partic1e size determinations may be made using a mu1ti - stage Anderson cascade impactor or other suitab1e method. A1ternatiVe1y , the dry poWder formu1ation may be prepared by spray drying or so1ution precipitation techniques. Spray drying has the adVantage of being the 1east prone to degrading the tref0i1 peptides. So1uti0n precipitation is performed by adding a co - so1Vent that decreases the so1ubi1ity of a drug to a uniform drug so1ution. When sufﬁcient co - so1Vent is addedthe so1ubi1ity 0f the drug fa11s t0 the p0int Where so1id drug partic1es are f0rmed Which can be c011ected by ﬁ1trati0n or centrifugation. Precipitation has the adVantage of being high1y reproducib1e and can be performed under 10W temperature conditions , Which reduce degradation. Super - critica1 ﬁuid techno1ogy can pr0duce partic1es 0f pharmaceutica1 c0mp0unds With the c0ntr011ed size , density and crysta11inity idea1 for poWder formu1ations. [ 0045 ] The dry poWder formu1ations 0f the present inVen - ti0n may be used direct1y in metered d0se 0r dry p0Wder inha1ers. Current1y , metered dose inha1er techno1ogy is optimized to de1iVer masses of 1 microgram to 5 mg of a therapeutic. Spacertechno1ogy , such as the aerochamber , may a1so be uti1ized t0 enhance pu1m0nary exp0sure and to assist patient c0ordination. Sep. 10 , 2009. [ 0046 ] An a1ternate route of dry poWder de1iVery is by dry poWder inha1ers. There are tWo maj0r designs 0f dry p0Wder inha1ers , deVice - metering designs in Which a reserV0ir of drug is stored Within the deVice and the patient ‘1oads a dose of the deVice into the inha1ation chamber , and the inspiratory ﬁoW of the patient acce1erates the poWder out of the deVice and into the ora1 caVity. A1ternatiVe1y , dry p0Wder inha1ers may a1so emp10y an air source , a gas source , 0r e1ectr0statics , in order to de1iVer the trefoi1 peptide. Current techno1ogy for dry poWder inha1ers is such that pay1oad1imits are around 10 mg of poWder. The dry poWder formu1ations are temperature stab1e and haVe a physio1ogica11y acceptab1e pH 0f 4.0 - 7.5 , prefer - ab1y 6.5 to 7.0. Therapeutic Agents. [ 0047 ] ln addition to the trefoi1 peptide , the therapeutic formu1ation according to the present inVention may a1so comprise a second therapeutic agent , or regimen. The second therapeutic agent may be administered Within ( either before , 0r after administration of the trefoi1 peptide ) 14 days , 7 days , 1 day , 12 hours , 1 hour , or simu1taneous1y With the trefoi1 peptide. The second therapeutic agent can a1so be present in the same or different pharmaceutica1 compositions as the trefoi1 peptide. Thus , pharmaceutica1 compositions for 10ca11y treating the respiratory epithe1ium may inc1ude , in addition to a trefoi1 peptide , for examp1e , an anti - inﬁammatory compound , an antibiotic , a beta - adrenergic bronchodi1a - tor , a cho1inergic receptor antagonist , a neurokinin receptor antagonist , a steroid , a decongestant , a phosphodiesterase inhibitor , an ana1gesic , or an anesthetic. When the second therapeutic agent is present in a different pharmaceutica1 composition , different routes of administration may be used. For examp1e , the second therapeutic agent may be administered ora11y , or by intraVenous , intramuscu1ar , or subcutaneous injection. Thus , the second therapeutic agent need not be administered by inha1ation. lf desired , more than one therapeutic agent may be administered With the trefoi1 peptide. Of course , pharmaceutica1 compositions may a1so contain tWo , three , or more trefoi1 peptides , or bio1ogica11y actiVe fragments. Tref0i1 Peptides. [ 0048 ] The therapeutic tref0i1 peptide ( s ) are typica11y mamma1ian intestina1 trefoi1 peptides. Preferab1y , human intestina1 trefoi1 peptides are used ; hoWeVer , trefoi1 peptides from other species inc1uding rat , mouse , and non - human primate , may be used. Typica11y , the trefoi1 peptide is intestina1 tref0i1 factor ( lTF ) ; hoWeVer , spasmo1ytic po1ypeptide ( SP ) , or pS2 are a1so usefu1. Particu1ar1y usefu1 lTF fragments that retain bio1ogica1 actiVity inc1ude the po1ypeptide corresponding to amino acid residues 15 - 73 of SEQ lD NO : 1 ( 1TFl5_73 ) and amin0 acid residues 21 - 73 0f SEQ lD NO : 1 ( 1TF2 1 - 73 ) - Other usefu1 lTF fragments are formed fo11oWing c1eaVage of the C - termina1 pheny1a1anine residue ( i. e. , lTFl_72 , lTF15_72 , and lTF21_72 ) . [ 0049 ] The trefoi1 peptides , inc1uding lTF , are so1ub1e , and can theref0re be disso1Ved in a pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e carrier 1iquid f0r aer0 so1ization or nebu1izati0n for examp1e. Aeroso1s containing a trefoi1 peptide are optimized for aerodynamic partic1e size , to target airWay regions of interest. Typica11y aeroso1 sizes of 1 - 3 micron target deep 1ung ( a1Veo - 1ar ) structures , Whi1e a partic1e size 0f 5 - 10 micron resu1t in trache0 - br0nchia1 dep0siti0n. More0Ver certain excipients. US 2009 / 0227511 A1. may be used to pro1ong the 10ca1 re1ease of a trefoi1 peptide de1iVered in the 1ung or nasa1 region , or to retain the trefoi1 peptide formu1ati0n in the desired 10ca1 area of the 1ung by m0difying the muc0ci1iary c1earance rate. Trefoi1 Peptide Dosages. [ 0050 ] Typica11y , the dosage , frequency and durati0n 0f therapy are tai1ored to the type and seVerity of the 1esion being treated. For examp1e , intermittent dosing may be sufﬁcient to treat minor airWay 1esi0ns. M0re seVere airWay 1esi0ns , resu1ting from , for examp1e , seVere smoke inha1ation or ther - ma1 damage , may require continuous trefoi1 peptide administration. A1ternatiVe1y , treatment may a1so be administered prophy1actica11y , in anticipati0n 0f 1esi0ns to the respiratory epithe1ium. The prophy1actic treatment may begin at 1east one day , three days , ﬁVe days , seVen days , or ten days prior to the insu1t. Treatment of unanticipated airWay 1esions preferab1y begin immediate1y after insu1t , 0r Within 24 h0urs. Preferab1y , trefoi1 peptide therapy is administered at 1east one , tWo , three , four , or more than four times per day for at 1east one day , ﬁVe days , fourteen days , or eVen for the 1ifetime of the patient being treated. A1ternatiVe1y , the trefoi1 peptide may be continuous1y administered to the patient oVer a set period of time , for a duration of one hour , tWo hours , 6 hours , one day , or more than one day for examp1e. For this purpose , the trefoi1 peptide may be administered using a mask adapter of a nebu - 1izer system , for examp1e. [ 0051 ] Preferab1y , aeroso1 formu1ation contains a trefoi1 peptide concentration of 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 mg / mL , or more and is formu1ated in a physio1ogica11y acceptab1e so1u - tion , preferab1y in one quarter strength of norma1 sa1ine. ldea11y , the patient is administered With at 1east 10 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 700 , 1000 , or more than 1000 micrograms of a trefoi1 peptide administered as an aeroso1. The use of dry poWder inha1ation preferab1y resu1ts in the de1iVery of at 1east about 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , or more than 60 mg of the trefoi1 peptide to the respiratory airWays of the patient receiVing treatment. ln such a formu1ation , the trefoi1 peptide is de1iVered as a poWder in an amorphous or crysta11ine state in partic1e sizes betWeen 1 and 10 microns in mass median aerodynamic diameter necessary for efﬁcacious de1iVery of the trefoi1 peptide into the endobronchia1 space for treatment , ame1i0rati0n , and preVenti0n 0f 1esions of the respirat0ry epithe1ium. Fractions of 2 to 4 microns may a1so be emp10yed to target the periphera1 1ung. Patient inspiration techniques , such as breath ho1ding for examp1e , may a1so optimize deposition of the trefoi1 peptide. [ 0052 ] lf desired , the tref0i1 peptide may a1so be administered ora11y , 0r by intraVenous injection , particu1ar1y in cases in Which contro11ed or continuous re1ease of the trefoi1 peptide is the goa1. [ 0053 ] A11 of the therapeutic agents emp1oyed in the com - p0siti0ns 0f the present inVenti0n , inc1uding the trefoi1 peptide component , can be used in the dose ranges current1y knoWn and used for these agents. Different concentrations of either the trefoi1 peptide or the other agents may be emp1oyed depending 0n the c1inica1 c0ndition 0f the patient , the g0a1 0f the therapy ( treatment or prophy1axis ) , the anticipated duration , the 1esion site , and the seVerity of the damage for Which the trefoi1 peptide is being administered. Additiona1 considerations in dose se1ection inc1ude : disease etio1ogy , patient age ( pediatric , adu1t , geriatric ) , genera1hea1th and comorbid - . ity. Anti - lnﬁammatory Agents. [ 0054 ] Any suitab1e anti - inﬁammat0ry agent can be f0rmu - 1ated With the tref0i1 peptide and emp1oyed using the meth0d. Sep. 10 , 2009. of this inVention. Suitab1e anti - inﬁammatory agents can be administered systemica11y , or can be administered by inha1a - ti0n. Exemp1ary agents inc1ude , but are not 1imited t0 n0n - steroida1 anti - inﬁammatory drugs ( e. g. , ibuprofen , tacro1i - mus , Cromo1yn , Nedocromi1 ) , cyc1ooxygenase - 2 - speciﬁc inhibitors such as rofecoxib ( Vioxx® ) and ce1ecoxib ( Ce1e - brex® ) , and g1ucocortic0ids. Particu1ar1y effectiVe g1uc0c0r - tic0 ster0id agents that may be used by aer0 s01izati0n inc1ude for examp1e bec1omethasone , ﬁuniso1ide , budesonide and triamcino1one. Other useﬁi1 g1ucocorticoisteroid agents inc1ude predniso1one , dexamethasone and ﬁuticasone. A1though asthma is the main 1ung condition in Which cortic0steroids are used , such agents may a1so be usefu1 When the respiratory epithe1ium is damaged by cigarette smoke as in chronic bronchitis and emphysema for examp1e. Corticosteroids are a1so useful in the treatment of other 1ung diseases such as sarcoidosis , a1Ve01itis and chr0nic inﬁammat0ry c0nditi0ns. These drugs may be giVen ora11y , intraVenous1y ( e. g. , in seVere cases ) , or by inha1ation. Preferab1y , inha1ed corticosteroids are administered to the patient because the dose required is much 1ess and is de1iVered direct1y to the sma11 air passages in the 1ungs With feWer associated side effects. [ 0055 ] Anti - inﬁammatory concentrations knoWn to be effectiVe fo11oWing inha1ation administration can be used. For examp1e , ibuprofen may be present in the composition at concentrations sufﬁcient to de1iVer betWeen 25 - 800 mg per day to the respiratory 1esion. Bronchodi1ator Agents. [ 0056 ] Any actiVe bronchodi1ator agent may be co - formu - 1ated With the trefoi1 peptide in the usua1 doses for respiratory app1ication to the nasa1 - pharyngea1 or tracheo - bronchia1 anatomy. Useﬁ11bronchodi1ators inc1ude , but are not 1imited to methy1xanthines ( e. g. , theophy11ine , theobromine , and caffeine ) , sympathomimetic agents ( e. g. , adrena1ine , epinephrine , isoprotereno1 , and beta - adrenergic agonists ) , cho1inergic receptor antagonists such as ipratroprium bromide and tiotropium and neurokinin receptor antagonists. [ 0057 ] Adrenergic bronchodi1ators are usua11y administered by inha1ation to open up the bronchia1 tubes ( air passages ) of the 1ungs and are typica11y used to treat , ame1iorate , or preVent the symptoms of asthma , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , and other 1ung diseases. Such exemp1ary bronchodi1ators inc1ude a1butero1 , bito1tero1 , epinephrine , fenotero1 , formotero1 , is0etharine , isoprotereno1 , metaprotereno1 , pirbutero1 , procatero1 , racepinephrine , sa1metero1 , and terbuta1ine. [ 0058 ] A1ternatiVe1y , the trefoi1 peptide of the inVention may be administered With a 1eukotriene receptor antagonist ( e. g. , monte1ukast , or zaﬁr1ukast ) , a neurokinin recept0r antagonist , an antihistamine ( e. g. , diphenhydramine , fexofenadine , cetirizine , or 1oratadine ) or a cho1inergic receptor antagonist. Antimicrobia1 Agents. [ 0059 ] Any suitab1e antimicrobia1 agent can be used in the c0mpositions 0f the inVenti0n at c0ncentrati0ns genera11y used f0r these agents. Suitab1e antimicrobia1 agents inc1ude , antibacteria1 , antiﬁinga1 , antiparasitic , and antiVira1 agents. Exemp1ary antibacteria1 agents ( antibiotics ) inc1ude the peni - ci11ins ( e. g. , penici11in G , ampici11in , methici11in , oxaci11in , and amoxici11in ) , the cepha10sporins ( e. g. , cefadroxi1 , cef0 - ranid , cef0taxime , and ceftriax0ne ) , the tetracyc1ines ( e. g. , . US 2009 / 0227511 A1. doxycyc1ine , minocyc1ine , and tetracyc1ine ) , the aminog1y - cosides ( e. g. , amikacin , gentamycin , kanamycin , neomycin , strept0mycin , and t0bramycin ) , the macr01ides ( e. g. , azithr0 - mycin , c1arithromycin , and erythromycin ) , the ﬁuoroquino - 10nes ( e. g. , ciproﬁoxacin , 10meﬁoxacin , and norﬁoxacin ) , and other antibiotics inc1uding ch1oramphenico1 , c1indamycin , cyc1oserine , isoniazid , rifampin , and Vanc0mycin. Particu1ar1y usefu1 f0rmu1ati0ns c0ntain amin0g1yc0sides , inc1uding for examp1e amikacin , gentamicin , kanamycin , neomycin , neti1micin , paromomycin , streptomycin , and tobramycin. [ 0060 ] AntiVira1 agents are substances capab1e of destroying or suppressing the rep1ication of Viruses. Examp1es of anti - Vira1 agents inc1ude 1 , - D - riboﬁ1rano sy1 - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazo1e - 3 carb0xamide , 9 - >2 - hydr0xy - eth0xy methy1guanine , adamantanamine , 5 - iodo - 2 ' - deoxyuridine , triﬁuorothymidine , interferon , adenine arabinoside , protease inhibitors , thymidine kinase inhibitors , sugar or g1ycoprotein synthesis inhibitors , structura1 protein synthesis inhibitors , attachment and ads0rption inhibitors , and nuc1e0side ana10gues such as acy - c1oVir , pencic1oVir , Va1acyc1oVir , and gancic1oVir. [ 0061 ] Antiﬁinga1 agents inc1ude both fungicida1 and fungistatic agents such as , for examp1e , benzoic acid , unde - cy1enic a1kano1amide , cic1opirox olamine , po1yenes , imida - zo1es , a11y1amine , thicarbamates , amphotericin B , buty1paraben , c1indamycin , econaxo1e , ﬁuconazo1e , ﬁucytosine , griseoﬁ11Vin , nystatin , and ketoconazo1e. [ 0062 ] Other antimicrobia1 agents such as the antiparasitics 1ike pentamidine , are knoWn to haVe respiratory side effects. Therefore , co - administration of a trefoi1 peptide and an antimicrobia1 of this type may reduce or preVent adVerse eVents. [ 0063 ] Antimicrobia1 concentrations knoWn to be effectiVe in treating respiratory infections can be used. Anticancer Agents. [ 0064 ] Cancers of the 1ung , inc1uding sma11 ce11 and nonsma11 ce11 carcinomas , damage the 1ung epithe1ium. Frequent1y , this injury is exacerbated by anticancer therapy because many anticancer agents haVe adVerse effects on epithe1ia1 ce11s. Theref0re , it is beneﬁcia1 t0 administer trefoi1 peptide therapy in anticipation of , c0ncurrent to , or fo11oWing antineop1astic therapy to preVent , ame1iorate , or treat damage to the respiratory epithe1ium. Chemotherapeutics are usua11y administered systemica11y by intraVenous injection. The trefoi1 peptides may administered simu1taneous1y , as an additiVe to the chemotherapeutic preparation , or separate1y , by inha - 1ation. For patients undergoing radiation therapy , trefoi1 peptides are preferab1y administered by inha1ation beginning one to three days prior to each therapeutic session , continuing thr0ugh the c0urse 0f therapy , and continuing f0r 0ne t0 three days after the ﬁna1 radiation treatment. Production of Trefoi1 Peptides. [ 0065 ] Trefoi1 peptides and fragments can be produced by any method knoWn in the art for expression of recombinant proteins. Nuc1eic acids that encode trefoi1 peptides may be introduced into Various ce11 types or ce11 - free systems f0r expressi0n thereby a110Wing 1arge - sca1e pr0ducti0n , puriﬁcation , and patient therapy. [ 0066 ] Eukaryotic and prokaryotic trefoi1 peptide expression systems may be generated in Which a trefoi1 peptide gene sequence is intr0duced int0 a p1asmid or other Vect0r , Which is then used to transf0rm1iVing ce11s. C0nstructs in Which the. Sep. 10 , 2009. trefoi1 peptide cDNA contains the entire open reading frame inserted in the c0rrect 0rientati0n int0 an expressi0n p1asmid may be used f0r pr0tein expressi0n. Pr0kary0tic and eukaryotic expression systems a11oW for the expression and recoVery of trefoi1 peptide fusion proteins in Which the trefoi1 peptide is coVa1ent1y 1inked to a tag mo1ecu1e , Which faci1itates iden - tiﬁcati0n and / or puriﬁcati0n. An enzymatic or chemica1 c1eaVage site can be engineered betWeen the trefoi1 peptide and the tag mo1ecu1e so that the tag can be remoVed fo11oWing puriﬁcation. [ 0067 ] Typica1 expression Vect0rs c0ntain pr0m0ters that direct the synthesis of 1arge amounts of mRNA corresponding to the inserted trefoi1 peptide nuc1eic acid in the p1asmidbearing ce11s. They may a1so inc1ude a eukaryotic or prokary - 0tic 0rigin of rep1ication sequence a11oWing for their auton0 - mous rep1ication Within the host organism , sequences that encode genetic traits that a11oW Vector - containing ce11s to be se1ected for in the presence of otherWise toxic drugs , and sequences that increase the efﬁciency With Which the synthesized mRNA is trans1ated. Stab1e 10ng - term Vectors may be maintained as free1y rep1icating entities by using regu1atory e1ements of , for examp1e , Viruses ( e. g. , the OriP sequences from the Epstein Barr V1rus genome ) . Ce11 1ines may a1so be produced that haVe integrated the Vector into the genomic DNA , and in this manner the gene product is produced on a continuous basis. [ 0068 ] Expression of foreign sequences in bacteria , such as Escherichia coli , requires the insertion of a trefoi1 peptide nuc1eic acid sequence into a bacteria1 expression Vector. Such p1asmid Vectors contain seVera1 e1ements required for the propagation of the p1asmid in bacteria , and for expression of the DNA inserted into the p1asmid. Propagation of on1y p1asmid - bearing bacteria is achieVed by intr0ducing , into the p1asmid , se1ectab1e marker - encoding sequences that a11oW p1asmid - bearing bacteria to groW in the presence of otherWise toxic drugs. The p1asmid a1so contains a transcriptiona1 promoter capab1e of producing 1arge amounts of mRNA from the c1oned gene. Such promoters may be ( but are not necessari1y ) inducib1e promoters that initiate transcription upon induction. The p1asmid a1so preferab1y contains a po1y1inker to simp1ify insertion of the gene in the correct orientation Within the Vector. Bio1ogica11y actiVe trefoi1 peptides a1so can be produced using a Pichia yeast expression system ( see , for examp1e , U. S. Pat. Nos. 4 , 882 , 279 and 5 , 122 , 465 ; hereby incorporated by reference ) . [ 0069 ] Mamma1ian ce11s can a1so be used to express a trefoi1 peptide. Stab1e or transient ce11 1ine c1ones can be made using trefoi1 peptide expression Vectors to produce the trefoi1 peptides in a so1ub1e ( truncated and tagged ) form. Appropriate ce111inesinc1ude , f0r examp1e , COS , HEK293T , CHO , 0r N1H ce11 1ines. [ 0070 ] Once the appropriate expression Vectors are constructed , they are intr0duced int0 an appropriate h0st ce11 by transf0rmati0n techniques , such as , but not 1imited t0 , ca1 - cium phosphate transfection , DEAE - dextran transfection , e1ectroporation , microinjection , protop1ast fusion , or 1iposome - mediated transfection. The host ce11s that are transfected With the Vect0rs 0f this inVenti0n may inc1ude ( but are not 1imited t0 ) E. 0011 ' 0r 0ther bacteria , yeast , fungi , insect ce11s ( using , for examp1e , bacu1oVira1 Vectors for expression in SF9 insect ce11s ) , or ce11s deriVed from mice , humans , or other anima1s. ln Vitro expression of trefoi1 peptides , ﬁ1sions , 0r p01ypeptide fragments encoded by c1oned DNA may a1so be used. Those ski11ed in the art of m01ecu1ar bio10gy Wi11. US 2009 / 0227511 A1. understand that a Wide Variety of expression systems and puriﬁcati0n systems may be used to pr0duce rec0mbinant tref0i1 peptides and fragments there0f. Some 0f these systems are described , for examp1e , in Ausube1 et a1. ( Current Proto - co1s in Mo1ecu1ar Bio1ogy , John Wi1ey & Sons , NeW York , N. Y. 2000 , hereby incorporated by reference ) . [ 0071 ] Transgenic p1ants , p1ant ce11s and a1gae are a1so particu1ar1y usefu1 for generating rec0mbinant tref0i1 peptides for use in the methods and compositions of the inVention. For examp1e , transgenic tobacco p1ants or cu1tured transgenic tobacco p1ant ce11s expressing a trefoi1 peptide can be created using techniques kn0Wn in the art ( see , f0r examp1e , U. S. Pat. Nos. 5 , 202 , 422 and 6 , 140 , 075 ) . Transgenic a1gae expression systems can a1so be used to produce recombinant trefoi1 peptides ( see , for examp1e , Chen et a1. , Curr. Genet. 39 : 365 - 370 , 2001 ) . [ 0072 ] Once a recombinant protein is expressed , it can be iso1ated from ce11 1ysates using protein puriﬁcation techniques such as afﬁnity chromatography. Once iso1ated , the recombinant protein can , if desired , be puriﬁed ﬁirther by e. g. , high performance 1iquid chromatography ( HPLC ; e. g. , see Fisher , Laboratory Techniques 1n Biochemistry And Mo1ecu1ar Bio1ogy , Work and Burdon , Eds. , E1seVier , 1980 ) . [ 0073 ] Po1ypeptides of the inVention , particu1ar1y trefoi1 peptide fragments can a1so be produced by chemica1 synthesis using , for examp1e , Merriﬁe1d so1id phase synthesis , so1u - tion phase synthesis , or a combination of both ( see , for examp1e , the methods described in So1id Phase Peptide Synthesis , 2nd ed. , 1984 , The Pierce Chemica1 Co. , Rockford , 111. ) . Optiona11y , peptide fragments are then be condensed by standard peptide assemb1y chemistry. [ 0074 ] The fo11oWing examp1es are intended to i11ustrate the princip1e of the present inVention and circumstances When trefoi1 peptide therapy is indicated. The fo11oWing examp1es are not intended to be 1imiting. Examp1e 1 Treatment of Rhinitis due to RhinoVirus. [ 0075 ] The patient is administered a trefoi1 peptide - c0n - taining preparation beginning immediate1y after the onset of a head co1d. The preparation contains a therapeutic dose of lTFl5_73. The trefoi1 peptide can be administered as a nasa1 spray using standard formu1ating methods to de1iVer 100 micr01iters 0f a 50 mg / m1 spray 0f trefoi1 peptide. The patient receiVes medication by se1f - administering the nasa1 spray eVery 12 hours for the next ﬁVe consecutiVe days. A1so , the trefoi1 peptide actiVe materia1 may be app1ied With the stan - . dard dose of a nasa1 decongestant spray ( e. g. 0.05% oxymeta - z01ine HC1 ) . Examp1e 2 Treatment 0f A11ergic Rhinitis due t0 Grass P011en. [ 0076 ] During hay feVer season , the patient affected With a11ergic rhinitis is administered With antihistamines such as diphenhydramine , fexofenadine , cetirizine , or 10ratadine. A1so , the patient is c0ncurrent1y administered a nasa1 spray preparati0n c0ntaining a therapeutic dose 0f 1TF15_73. This component , in one examp1e , is a nasa1 spray using standard formu1ating methods to de1iVer a 5 mg / m1 spray of lTF. Continuing for the subsequent ﬁVe days , the patient receiVes medication by se1f - administered nasa1 spray eVery 12 hours 0r as needed. 1n seVere cases , the 1TF actiVe materia1 may. Sep. 10 , 2009. ﬁirther be app1ied With the standard dose of a nasa1 g1ucocortic0id spray ( e. g. , bec1omethasone , ﬁuticasone , mometas0ne , 0r triamcino10ne ) . Examp1e 3 Treatment of a Post Vira1 Pro1onged Bronchospasm. [ 0077 ] 1n treatments f0r post - Vira1 tracheo - br0nchia1 epithe1ia1 disrupti0n , the trefoi1 peptide c0ntaining materia1 may be co - formu1ated With the standard dose of an inha1ed sa1metero1 preparation , in a dry poWder inha1er , an aeroso1 metered dose inha1er , or as a so1ution or a suspension in a u1trasonic or air - j et nebu1iser. The treatment continues With the patient se1f - administering the medication eVery 12 hours for a period of at 1east 72 hours. Examp1e 4. Treatment of Adu1t Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) . [ 0078 ] Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is a characteristic response of the 1ung in reaction to a Wide Variety of injury. Treatment of ARDS is initiated as soon as possib1e to minimize damage caused to the 1ung. The objectiVe of treatment is to proVide enough support for the fai1ing respiratory system ( and other systems ) unti1 these systems haVe time to heal The main supportiVe treatment of the fai1ing respiratory system in ARDS is mechanica1 Venti1ation ( a breathing machine ) to de1iVer high doses of oxygen and a continuous 1eVe1 of pressure ca11ed PEEP ( positiVe end - expiratory pressure ) to the damaged 1ungs. To speed hea1ing , a trefoi1 peptide is administered by inha1ation to patients With estab1ished ARDS or a syndrome of pre - ARDS. The amount of lTF2 1 - 73 Wi11 be on the order of 1000 mg eVery 24 hours. The treatment is continued for at 1east 72 hours depending on the seVerity of the case and the c1inica1 response of the patient. The regimen is repeated unti1 hea1ing or for ten days of therapy. lt may be m0re c0nVenient t0 administer tref0i1 pr0 - teins to these patients 1ess frequent1y ( e. g. eVery 12 or 24 hours ) and in higher concentrations With or Without formu1a - tions to enhance the exposure of the 1ung capi11ary epithe1ium to the peptide. Additiona1 forms of treatment that may be used a1ong With the tref0i1 peptide therapy inc1ude f0r examp1e antibi0tics , immunosuppressants , b1ood pressure supporting medications , tube feedings , and diuretics , Which are used to reduce the ﬁuid in the 1ungs. Since the patho1ogy of ARDS is a1so 1inked to excessiVe1y produced nitric oxide , a NO b1ocker may be administered , if desired. Examp1e 5 Treatment of Human Respiratory Syncitia1 Virus. [ 0079 ] Human respirat0ry syncitia1 Virus is the mo st imp0r - tant cause of h0spita1izati0ns f0r Vira1 respiratory tract disease in young chi1dren Wor1dWide. Primary infection usua11y causes upper respiratory symptoms. A1though the infection initiates in the upper respiratory tract , it can spread to the 10Wer tract , Via aspirati0n 0f secretions or Via the respirat0ry epithe1ium , causing bronchi01itis and pneum0nia. During the infection , RSV causes extensiVe damage to the epithe1ium and the bronchio1ar ci1iary apparatus. Chi1dren affected by RSV may be administered lTF therapy to acce1erate recoVery 0f the respirat0ry epithe1ium. Patients are administered a tref0i1 peptide by inha1ati0n , using for examp1e , a dry p0Wder. US 2009 / 0227511 A1. inha1er , an aeroso1 metered dose inha1ed , a so1ution or a suspension in a u1trasonic 0r air - jet nebu1iser. The trefoi1 peptide is administered three times a day , at a d0se 0f 1 mg / puff. Desirab1y , RibaVirin , an aeroso1ized drug that can reduce the seVerity and the duration of i11ness , is a1so administered. Examp1e 6 Treatment 0f lnﬁuenza 1nfection. [ 0080 ] The inﬁuenza Virus infects epithe1ia1 ce11s of the trachea and the br0nchi. ExtensiVe damage t0 the epithe1ium due to infection can cause seVere coughing as We11 as pain in the chest , and the re1ease of cytokines from damaged ce11s can further cause feVer , chi11s , ma1aise , and muscu1ar pains. A1so , seVere destruction of the mucous epithe1ium may 1ead to secondary bacteria1 infecti0n and br0nchitis. T0 a11eViate the symptoms and acce1erate the rate of recoVery , the patient is administered trefoi1 peptide therapy as soon as symptoms of infection are manifested. lTF , or a bio1ogica11y actiVe fragment thereof , is administered in a dry poWder inha1er , an aeroso1 metered d0se inha1ed , 0r as a so1uti0n or a suspensi0n in an u1trasonic or air - jet nebu1iser. A1ternatiVe1y , patients may a1so be administered the trefoi1 peptide therapy by a nasa1 spray. This therapy is administered three to four times a day , and may be continued for a Week fo11oWing dissipation of the symptoms. Examp1e 7 Treatment of Chronic Bronchitis. [ 0081 ] Chronic Bronchitis is typica11y caused by chronic irritation of the respiratory airWays or by microbia1 infections. As such , it is a condition often associated With smoking and its incidence is often associated With emphysema. Patients typica11y haVe a chronic cough With sputum. Damage to the epithe1ium from chronic bronchitis may predispose indiVidua1s to pneumococca1 bacteria1 inVasion , Which can 1ead to further comp1ications , such as pneumonia. Therefore , restoration or improVement of the respiratory epithe1ium can a11eViate symptoms ass0ciated With chronic bronchitis. Patients diagnosed With chronic bronchitis , or smokers , are immediate1y administered With a trefoi1 peptide in a dry poWder inha1er , an aero so1 metered dose inha1ed , or as a so1ution. Sep. 10 , 2009. or a suspension in an u1trasonic or air - j et nebu1iser. Patients can se1f - administer this regimen at 1east three times a day , f0r a peri0d 0f at 1east seVen days , 0r unti1 the c0ughing ceases. 1f desired , the trefoi1 peptide therapy may a1so inc1ude administration of antibiotics. Examp1e 8 Treatment of Lesions Caused by Smoke lnha1ation. [ 0082 ] Direct toxic effects caused by rapid1y acting toxins such as smoke can incapacitate patients Within moments. As such , the resu1ting effects , Which inc1ude bronch0spasm and a1Veo1ar damage , may cause rapid deterioration of the patient and high morta1ities. lnha1ation of smoke can initiate an inﬁammatory response in a patient causing the re1ease of histamine and other VasoactiVe sub stances that cause damage t0 the respirat0ry epithe1ium. Treatment Wi11 Vary With the seVerity of the damage caused by smoke inha1ation. The primary focus of treatment is to maintain an open airWay and proVide an adequate 1eVe1 of oxygen. lf the airWay is open and stab1e , the patient may be giVen high - ﬁoW humidiﬁed 100% 0xygen by mask. 1f sWe11ing of the airWay tissues is c1osing off the airWay , the patient may require the insertion of an endotrachea1 tube to artiﬁcia11y maintain an open airWay. [ 0083 ] The patient is a1so immediate1y and continuous1y administered lTF 15 - 73 by jet nebu1izer for at 1east ﬁVe days to reduce smoke - induced damage to the airWay epithe1ium and the de1eterious effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapies. Examp1e 9 Treatment of Asthma. [ 0084 ] The management of asthma is concerned primari1y With the re1ief and preVention of symptoms through the treatment of under1ying inﬁammatory processes , Which cause damage to the respiratory epithe1ium. Furthermore , if untreated , chronic inﬁammation makes the airWays hyperresponsiVe to stimu1i such as co1d air , exercise , dust mites , po11utants in the air , thus exacerbating damage to the epithe - 1ium. Consequent1y , the asthmatic patient is administered With theophy11ine , an anti - inﬁammatory agent and a therapeutica11y effectiVe amount of lTF 15 - 73 to ame1iorate asthmaassociated symptoms and to reduce damage to the respiratory airWays. .
