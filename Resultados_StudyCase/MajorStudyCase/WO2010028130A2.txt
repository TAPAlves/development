A number 0f n0ntricyc1iC antidepressants haVe recent1y been deVe10ped that reduce the cardi0VascuIar and antich01inergic adVerse - side effects as s0ciated With tricycIic antidepressants. Some 0f these 00mp0unds are aIs0 used as anti—0besity agents and haVe sh0Wn pr0mise in the treatment 0f Parkins0n ' s disease and seniIe dementia. See , e. g. , WO 94 / 00047 and WO 94 / 00114. The n0ntricyclic C0mp0und 1 , known as Ven1afaXine 0r by its chemica1 name 1— [ 2— ( dimethyIamin0 ) - 1— ( 4— methoXyphenyI ) ethy1 ] cycI0heXan0I and as 1— [ 0L— [ ( dimethy1 - amin0 ) methy1 ] - p - methoXybenzy1 ] cycI0heXan0I , is an antidepressant Which has been studied eXtensiVer and Which is described in , f0r eXamp1e , U. S. Patent N0. 4 , 761 , 501 and Pent0 , J. T. Drugs 0f the Future 13 ( 9 ) : 839—840 ( 1988 ) . Its hydrochI0ride sa1t is a. c1inicaI1y and 00mmercia11y imp0rtant antidepressant agent With annua1 sa1es in 2005. 0f $3.5B ( Wyeth 2005 annua1rep0rt ) . H3C. N / CH3. o—< >—< : H3C HO. Ven1afaXine contains an asymmetric carb0n at0m and is so1d as a racemate. In. C0mp0und 1. humans , Ven1afaXine is transf0rmed by a saturab1e metab01ic pathWay int0 0ne maj0r O - demethyIated metab0Iite , desVenIafaXine.

Indeed , desVen1afaXine is noW marketed by Wyeth in the United States for the treatment of major depressiVe disorder under the name Pristiq. DesVenIafaXine is registered for the treatment of postmenopausaI syndrome , and is in Phase III for fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain. Despite the beneficia1 actiVities of desVenIafaXine , there is a continuing need. for neW compounds to treat the aforementioned diseases and conditions. Definiti0ns. The term “treat” incIudes both therapeutic and prophyIactic treatment. Both terms mean decrease , suppress , attenuate , diminish , arrest , or stabi1ize the deVe1opment or progression of a disease ( e. g. , a disease or disorder de1ineated herein ) . “Disease” means any condition or disorder that damages or interferes With the normaI function of a ce1I , tissue , or organ. It WiII be recognized that some Variation of naturaI isotopic abundance occurs in a synthesized compound depending upon the origin of chemicaI materiaIs used in the synthesis. Thus , a preparation of Compound 3 Wil1 inherently contain smaIl amounts of deuterated isotopoIogues. The concentration of naturaI1y abundant stab1e hydrogen and carbon isotopes , notWithstanding this Variation , is sma1I and immateriaI as compared to the degree of stab1e isotopic substitution of compounds of this inVention. See , for instance , Wada E et aI. , Seikagaku 1994 , 66 : 15 ; Gannes LZ et aI. , Comp Biochem Physiol MoI Integr Physiol 1998 , 119 : 725. In a compound of this inVention , When a particu1ar position is designated as haVing deuterium , it is understood that the abundance of deuterium at that position is substantiaﬂy greater than the natura1 abundance of deuterium , Which is 0.015%. A position designated as haVing deuterium typica11y has a minimum isotopic enrichment factor of at Ieast 3000 ( 45% deuterium incorporation ) at each atom designated as deuterium in said compound. The term “isotopic enrichment factor” as used herein means the ratio betWeen the isotopic abundance and the natura1 abundance of a specified isotope. In other embodiments , a compound of this inVention has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at Ieast 3500 ( 52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom ) , at Ieast 4000 ( 60%. deuterium incorporation ) , at Ieast 4500 ( 67.5% deuterium incorporation ) , at Ieast 5000. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2010 / 028130 PCT / US2009 / 055865. ( 75% deuterium ) , at Ieast 5500 ( 82.5% deuterium incorporation ) , at 1east 6000 ( 90% deuterium incorporation ) , at Ieast 6333.3 ( 95% deuterium incorporation ) , at 1east 6466.7 ( 97% deuterium incorporation ) , at least 6600 ( 99% deuterium incorporation ) , or at Ieast 6633.3 ( 99.5% deuterium incorporation ) . In the compounds of this inVention any atom not specifical1y designated as a particu1ar isotope is meant to represent any stab1e isotope of that atom. Unless otherWise stated , When a position is designated specifica11y as “H” or “hydrogen” , the position is understood to haVe hydrogen at its natura1 abundance isotopic composition. A1so un1ess otherWise stated , When a position is designated specifica11y as “D” or “deuterium” , the position is understood to haVe deuterium at an abundance that is at 1east 3340 times greater than the natura1 abundance of deuterium , Which is 0.015% ( i. e. , at 1east 50.1% incorporation of deuterium ) . The term “isotopo1ogue” refers to a species that differs from a specific compound of this inVention onIy in the isotopic composition thereof. The term “compound , ” as used herein , refers to a colIection of mo1ecuIes haVing an identica1chemicaI structure , eXcept that there may be isotopic Variation among the constituent atoms of the molecu1es. Thus , it WiII be c1ear to those of skiI1 in the art that a compound represented by a particu1ar chemica1 structure containing indicated deuterium atoms , Wi11 a1so contain Iesser amounts of isotopo1ogues haVing hydrogen atoms at one or more of the designated deuterium positions in that structure. The relatiVe amount of such isotopo1ogues in a compound of this inVention WilI depend upon a number of factors incIuding the isotopic purity of deuterated reagents used to make the compound and the efficiency of incorporation of deuterium in the Various synthesis steps used to prepare the compound. HoWeVer , as set forth aboVe the re1atiVe amount of such isotopo1ogues WiI1 be 16ss than 49.9% of the compound. In other embodiments , the re1atiVe amount of such isotopo1ogues in mm WiI1 be 1ess than 47.5% , less than 40% , Iess than 32.5% , less than 25% , Iess than 17.5% , 1ess than 10% , Iess than 5% , ICSS than 3% , 1ess than 1% , or less than 0.5% of the compound.

Combination therapies according to the present inVention thus incIude the administration of at least one compound of FormuIa I as WeI1 as optional use of other therapeutic agents inc1uding other anti—depressiVe or anti—anXio1ytic agents. Such combination of agents may be administered together or separate1y and , When administered separate1y this may occur simu1taneous1y or sequentia11y in any order , both close and remote in time. The amounts of the compound of Formu1aI and the other pharmaceuticaIIy actiVe agent ( s ) the reIatiVe timings of administration WiII be. se1ected in order to achieVe the desired combined therapeutic effect. Assays f0r c0mpounds that inhibit amine reuptake. Optionaﬂy , compounds described herein are tested in viv0 or in vitr0 for their abi1ity to ameIiorate a depressiVe disease or anXiety disorder ; or for their ability to inhibit the reuptake of a bioactiVe amine ( e. g. , norepinephrine , dopamine , serotonin ) . Such methods inc1ude , but are not 1imited to , assaying compounds of the inVention for the inhibition of bioactiVe amine reuptake. According1y , compounds of the inVention are assayed in vitm for binding to rat cortica1 membranes as described by Habert E et. aI. , Eur. J. PharmacoI. 1985 118 : 107. Radiolabeled Compound 1 Was found to bind to a sing1e , high affinity , saturabIe site ; compounds that haVe a simiIar binding profiIe. in such assays are identified as usefuI in the methods of the inVention. 25. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2010 / 028130 PCT / US2009 / 055865. Compounds that are therapeutica11y efficacious against a psycho1ogica1 disease described herein ( e. g. , a depressiVe disease or anXiety disorder ) are those that reduce the reuptake of a bioactiVe amine ( e. g. , serotonin , dopamine , norepinephrine ) . BioactiVe amines are stored in a pre—synaptic ceII and upon reIease into the synapse the amines act on a post—synaptic ceI1 to induce a physioIogica1 response. The actions of bioactiVe amines are terminated either by re - uptake into cel1s from Which they haVe been re1eased ( e. g. , pre - synaptic neurons ) or by enzymatic degradation. Compounds of the inVention that reduce the reuptake of bioactiVe amines can acute1y increase eXtrace11u1ar amine concentrations , 1eading to an increase in negatiVe feedback mediated by inhibitory presynaptic and somatodendritic receptors. As a resu1t , action potentia1 firing frequency and amounts of bioactiVe amines re1eased from presynaptic button can decrease. On chronic administration , doWnreguIation and / or desensitization of inhibitory receptors can occur , resu1ting in increased action potentia1 firing frequency and higher bioactiVe amines concentrations in the synaptic cIeft. Other methods for eVaIuating the effect of compounds of Formula I incIude , metabolic or pharmacologicaI studies using radiolabeIed tracers or precursor 10ading , microdiaIysis , assaying bioactiVe amines or their metaboIites in cerebrospinal ﬂuid ( CSF ) , b1ood or urine , imaging studies that may or may not re1y on radio1abe1ed tracers ( e. g. , PET and functiona1 magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI ) . If desired , compounds se1ected using any of the screening methods described herein are tested for their efficacy in animal models of depression , neuropathic pain , fibromyaIgia , and postmenopausaI syndrome.
