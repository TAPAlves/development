US 2011 / 0250259 A1. METHOD 0F TREATING AND PREVENTING BREAST DISEASES AND BREAST CANCER WITH MEDICATED FORMULA. BACKGROUND OF THE 1NVENTION. [ 0001 ] This is a method of treating and preVenting breast cancer in men , Women or anima1s , With a formula and a means of de1iVery of the formula With nipple , intraducta1 , ducta1 , and / or interducta1 administration that can be topical or an infusion. [ 0002 ] This formula consists of a liquid anti disease anti cancer formu1a that can be deliVered to the source Where breast cancer begins , Which is the ducta1 and intraductal system of the breast , With an intraducta1 infusion or Via a suction and pumping action of the deVice to irrigate the breast tissue , or a topic means of deliVery With the anti breast cancer anti breast inﬂammation anti breast ce11 atypia and hyperp1asia and breast We11ness formu1a. [ 0003 ] This formula may use chemotherapy agents , anti - inﬂammatory agents , With or Without an ionic deliVery systems for more reliable absorption into the breast With a topica1 agent or through the use of a deVice that is intraductal infusion or Via a suction and pumping action of the deVice to irrigate the breast tissue With the anti breast cancer anti breast inﬂammation anti breast cell atypia and hyperplasia and breast Wel1ness. [ 0004 ] This formu1a may include photonical1y programmable Water and neutraceutica1s in a form that has medicinal actiVities that may include but not limited to : decrease in oxidatiVe stress to cells , support of healthy DNA , RNA , mitochondria With its anti - inﬂammatory , anti cancer , anti angiogenesis , and anti - aggregatory actions of stopping c1ots , by use of an a1ka1ine charge of the Water and minera1s , preVenting a buildup of elements responsible cancer or the precursors of cancer , or atypia or inﬂammatory tissue or cancerous cells. [ 0005 ] This formula blocks the adVerse effect on synthesis of prostaglandins Which are chemicals that play a part in inﬂammation and harmful thrombotic actiVities , acidosis , and adVerse enVironmenta1 terrain of the breast and surrounding tissue , and thereby becoming a breast We11ness formula by treating or preVention of mutations of breast cells and tissues , and remediation of carcinogens , and restoring the homeostasis of the cells and tissues of the breast. [ 0006 ] This formula may use of antioxidants With and Without fucoidan , minerals that create an enVironment that are harmfu1 to cancer and its precursors to cancer , or causing agents and other antioXidants that haVe anti - oXidant , anti - inﬂammatory , pH stabi1izing , pain relieVing effects and Nutraceutical beneﬂts , beneﬂcial effects against the aging process that is caused in part by inﬂammatory cells , damaged ce1ls by oXidatiVe stress , or degeneration of cells and / or the surrounding tissues. [ 0007 ] This formula may inc1ude a DeliVery System With or Without trace minera1s , antioXidants and nutrients that co1lectiVe1y decrease oXidatiVe stress to ce11 With anti - inﬂammatory , and anti - aggregatory actions of stopping c1ots and bui1d up of elements responsible for heart attack , stroke , and sudden cardiac arrest , b1ocks the adVerse effect on synthesis of pro staglandins Which are chemicals that p1ay a part in inﬂammation and ha1mful thrombotic actiVities , the stab1e form and the se1ection of antioXidants in this formula inhibit inﬂammation that has been 1inked to chemicals or an acid state to the tissue or the accumulation of toXins in the tissue and With or Without the use of nanoneutraceuticals. These nanoneutra - . Oct. 13 , 2011. ceuticals are formed by use of this deVice Wherein a nutrient can be made more useful for the body such as a deliVery system for the nutrients as part of metabo1ic pathWays and entrance into ce1ls. [ 0008 ] The photonic and ultraViolet processing of the formula may produce nano - sized nutraceutical particulate materia1s for greater bioaVailabi1ity and usefulness for a breast We11ness and anti breast disease formu1a. These nutrients are also photoceutical , With photonic energy proces sing the Water or other nutrient for medicinal use With or Without the use of breast nipp1e catheter , breast ducta1 infusion and irrigation With a pump or use of a hand he1d deVice. [ 0009 ] This is a means of breast infusion of the formula that may be done With breast ducta1 medicated infusion and irrigation With a pump or use of a hand he1d deVice or mechanica1 means of ﬂoW Warm Water around the nipple area of the breast and al1oW for ﬂoW into the nipple and inside of the breast ductal system and breast tissue , With or Without a cup that alloWs for such a ﬂoW , With or Without the assistance of a breast nipple intraducta1 and intraductal catheter. [ 0010 ] This is a medicated formula for breast diseases of all kinds or for preVention of breast diseases of all kinds With or Without the use of 11posomes for enhanced use of the formula included in this patent , With or Without a deVice to assist de1iVery to the region of the breast and breast ducta1 region Via the breast nipple. [ 0011 ] Medicated formula With or Without the use of liposomes , With or Without the fo1loWing : alkaline sa1ts and other nutrients , anti - inﬂammatory agents , fucoidan , With or With one or more of the folloWing chemo therapy agents such as but not limited to : AbraXane ( paclitaxel protein - bound particles for injectable suspension ) , Adriamycin ( doXorubicin ) , Aredia ( generic name , pamidronate disodium ) , ArimideX ( anastrozo1e ) , Aromasin ( eXemestane ) , Chemotherapy Regimens of different kinds knoWn and not knoWn and yet to be discoVered , CytoXan ( cyclophosphamide ) , Ellence ( epirubicin ) , EVista ( raloXifene ) , Fareston ( toremifene ) , Femara ( 1etrozo1e ) , Herceptin ( trastuzumab ) , Megace ( megestro1 ) , TamoXifen , TaXo1 ( pac1itaXel ) , TaXotere ( docetaXe1 ) , Xeloda ( capecitabine ) , ZoladeX ( gosere1in acetate ) , Zometa ( generic name , zoledronic acid ) , and other agents. [ 0012 ] The elements contained in this formula for the treatment or preVention of breast diseases of a1l kinds , may be processed With or Without photonic programming or an ionic de1iVery system for greater effectiVeness and use against degeneratiVe diseases or cancerous or precancerous diseases , precursors of breast disease , inﬂammatory breast disease , or accumulation of toXins in the breast tissue that tend to concentrate in the breast such as , but not limited to mercury , cadmium , 1ead , heaVy meta1s , benzene , furans , organophosphates , petroleum deriVates , and other toXic substances. [ 0013 ] The elements contained in this formula for the treatment or preVention of breast diseases of all kinds may contain anti - inﬂammatory and reparatiVe properties and as an antiaging agent and We11ness formula , With or Without fucoidan for its beneﬂts , and With or Without alka1ine minerals for homeostasis of breast tissue , With or Without homeopathic formula for breast disease , hormonal balancing , and other nutrients. [ 0014 ] Some eXamples of nutrients that can be used inc1ude : Omega Fish Oi1 Concentrate , Flax Seed Oi1 , Borage Oil. 1n addition , there may be a Mineral Bio - MatriX , Trace Minerals , MSM , Piper Nigrum as an ionic deliVery system , and a NaturalAntioXidant CompleX that may consist of Ro se - . US 2011 / 0250259 A1. mary Oil , Alpha Tocopherol , Astaxanthin , and Algal Oil. Alga1 Oi1 can be used as a stabilizing agent to preVent oxidation of the essential fatty acids that cause oxidatiVe stress to ce11s When not stabilized. [ 0015 ] DegeneratiVe diseases such as breast cancer haVe been linked to a lack of nutrients as Well as metabo1ic deﬁ - ciencies and chemica1 imba1ances , toxins in food , acidosis , and toxins from the enVironment. The combination and indiVidual ingredients in this formula haVe particu1ar beneﬂts on breast disease , cancerous and precancerous breast lesions , and breast degeneratiVe disease. [ 0016 ] Components in this formula haVe the abilities to assist the cells of the breast against inﬂammation and disease by its assisting With assimilation of toxins , remoVing , eliminating , diminishing , processing , scaVaging free radica1s as sociated With cycles of cell disease , problems With cell and systemic metabo1ism , cel1u1ar acidosis , and the inﬂammatory process. [ 0017 ] This formula has anti - inﬂammatory agents , plus ionic deliVery systems for more reliable absorption through the use of a fo1m that is intraductal infusion or Via a suction and pumping action of the deVice to 111 ' igate the breast tissue With the anti breast cancer anti breast inﬂammation anti breast cell atypia and hyperplasia. [ 0018 ] The nutrients are sourced from the fol1oWing due to their quality , bioaVailability and leVel of essential fatty acids and the ability to be used With the stabilization process and With the ionic de1iVery process With this method of making an antioxidant hea1th care product : Omega Fish Oi1 Concentrate , F1ax Seed Oil , Borage Oil. In addition , there is an Ionic trace Minerals , MSM , Piper Nigrum as an ionic deliVery system , and a Natural Antioxidant Complex that consists of Rosemary Oil , Alpha Tocophero1 , Astaxanthin , and A1ga1 Oi1. A1ga1 Oi1 is used as a stabi1izing agent to preVent oxidation of the essential fatty acids. [ 0019 ] These remedies may be selected for treating Various conditions of the breast , especially breast cancer : Buf0 vu / — garis , C072ium macu / atum , Graphites , Mercurius , and Si1icea. [ 0020 ] The use of these and other homeopathic ingredients can be se1ected based on history of exposure to toxins and With clinical ﬂndings and subj ectiVe complaints , as Well as the condition of the patient. These are formed from heaVily diluted preparations , and these may be used With effects simi - 1ar to the diseases symptoms. This dilution is usual1y quite extensiVe , and often continues unti1 no mo1ecu1es of the original substance are likely to be found by routine testing. [ 0021 ] One in ﬂVe Women Who are breast feeding has e1eVated mercury leVels in their breast mi1k and many Women haVe concentrations of mercury and heaVy metals in the breast. The treatment for those Who are tested , exposed , possib1y exposed to mercury and heaVy a homeopathic formula may include Hepar sulph. , Kali iod. , Lachesis , Nitric acid , P / zym / acca , and Silicea , and Mercurius Wou1d not be se1ected Where there is a concern about mercury poisoning.

[ 0024 ] This formula and method of its deliVery to abnormal breast tissue or to preVent the formation of cancer or precursors to cancer or atypia or other fo1m of abnormal breast tissue. [ 0025 ] This formu1a consists of a 11quid anti disease anti cancer formu1a that can be de1iVered to the source Where breast cancer begins , Which is the ducta1 and intraducta1 , and / or interductal system of the breast. [ 0026 ] This is an intraductal and / or interducta1 infusion or Via a suction and pumping action of the deVice to irrigate the breast tissue With the anti breast cancer anti breast inﬂammation anti breast cell atypia and hyperplasia. [ 0027 ] This formula has anti - inﬂammatory agents , plus ionic deliVery systems for more reliable absorption through the use of a form that is intraductal infusion or Via a suction and pumping action of the deVice to irrigate the breast tissue With the anti breast cancer anti breast inﬂammation anti breast cell atypia and hyperplasia and breast Wellness. [ 0028 ] Method of making an a1kaline product With its anti - inﬂammatory and antioxidant formula With nutrients Wherein nutrients can be used and maintained in a suitable form to preVent the toxic effects of oxidation of product and free radical actiVity in a formu1a for immune support , antioxidant actiVity , anti coagu1ant actiVity and other actiVities , as a We11 - ness formula. The use nutrients in this formula that can be bioaVailable and haVe anti - oxidant actiVity that may be broad spectrum , Work as metabolic cata1ysts for the body , create better oxygen deliVery and nutrient de1iVery to ce11s due to the metabo1ic , nutrient , and electric affect on the body that has Wellness properties , anti - aging , immune enhancing and disease resistant actiVities , protectiVe beneﬂts for breast tissue. [ 0029 ] Problems that occur With arthritis , asthma , pain syndromes , and chronic diseases are inﬂammation and cell injury. The formula is designed to de1iVer maximum beneﬂts for these conditions. The senior author has done a lot of research in the area of chronic and degeneratiVe diseases during the 1ast 30 years. [ 003 0 ] There is concern that mammograms can damage breast ce11s With moderate to seVere compression and radiation , so much is the concern that medical scientists haVe suggested getting no more than 10 mammograms per lifetime of a Women. [ 0031 ] There is also legitimate concern of Women and scientists that mammograms may a1so spread breast cancer to other parts of the body due to the breast tissue being crushed in the process of doing the mammogram. [ 0032 ] Breast cancer is a common cancer in Women and cases in men haVe been increasing. [ 0033 ] Early diagnosis and treatments are Vital for better outcomes. [ 0034 ] Each year approximately 200 , 000 neW patients With breast cancer are diagnosed in North America , and 50 , 000 of those Wil1 die of the disease. Despite billions of do1lars poured. US 2011 / 0250259 A1. into research , public aWareness , and improVed treatment , the statistics haVe shoWn only modest improVement oVer the past tWenty years. The slight increase in surViVa1 is due to ear1ier diagnosis but mostly to improVed treatment. [ 0035 ] For breast cancer preVention With its Non - InVasiVe or inVasiVe use of infusion of formula for the treatment or preVention of breast disease , this can be done in a non inVasiVe or inVasiVe manner With or Without a breast nipp1e catheter and With or Without a hand held deVice or With or Without an electrical or non e1ectrical pump and suction deVice for use With the medicated solution for the breast disease or breast disease preVention. This formula With a deVice or method of de1iVery can be used With a Breast We1lness and Screening Program. [ 0036 ] If a Woman has a positiVe breast test for atypica1 cells , cancer situ , cancerous or precancerous cells in the breast or breast ducta1 region , there are many actions that Women can take to be proactiVe. Atypical cel1s may be the next step to breast cancer , just like those of the cerVical Pap test for cells that are not norma1 , so interVention With the deVice and formula of this inVention can treat or preVent disease. [ 003 7 ] In Women Who haVe no ﬂuid return or ce1ls on NAF testing ( Nipp1e Aspirate Fluid ) , this may be due to blockage by cancerous , inﬂammatory tissue , atypia , hyperp1asia , ﬂbrous tissue , scaring , and other abnormal breast and cellular tissue , these conditions may beneﬁt from the formula and deliVery systems of this inVention. [ 0038 ] There is c1ear eVidence that breast cancer has subgroups based on age. In younger patients the disease is more aggressiVe and difﬂcult to treat. The mortality in this group is signiﬂcantly higher than in the older age group. Early diagnosis is sti11 the WatchWord for improVing surViVa1 , but unfortunate1y ear1y diagnosis is most difﬂcult in the under 50 - age group. The reasons for this difﬂcu1ty are Varied , but the major problems haVe been that younger Women are concerned about cancer , but frequently in denial. They haVe a poor record of comp1iance for routine annua1 screening and doctors physi - ca1 exam and What to do about the cancer if it is found. [ 003 9 ] Younger Women tend to haVe denser tissue because their bodies are still producing lots of hormones Which stimulate breast tissue grthh. This formula can include a means of hormonal ba1ancing that is needed for breast Wel1ness , preVention and treatment of breast disease and cancer. [ 0040 ] Mammograms , the “go1d standard” of breast cancer diagnosis are on1y 50% sensitiVe to cancer in this dense breast group. EVen With neWer digital mammography , Which is present in a feW diagnostic centers , the sensitiVity only reaches to 70%. This means that one third to one half of a1l Women , especia11y younger ones , Wi1l fai1 to haVe their breast cancer diagnosed early using traditional approaches. This is likely a major reason Why death rates from breast cancer haVe changed Very litt1e oVer the past decades , and Why there is a need for early interVention and treatment. [ 0041 ] OVer these tWo decades many neW approaches to early diagnosis haVe been tried and abandoned. Light transmission diagnosis , electrical resistance , contact thermography has limitations. Breast se1f - exam is still the on1y recommended standard for Women under the age of 40 , though it sensitiVity ( ability to detect any disease ) and speciﬂcity ( accuracy in predicting cancer ) are extreme1y low It is stil1 recommended by all the cancer societies and the federal goVernment for tWo reasons. The ﬂrst is that the incidence of cancer in the under 40 age group is loW , and therefore one. Oct. 13 , 2011. Would haVe to spend a lot of insurers money on other screening tests to pick up relatiVely feW cancers. The second is that self - exam giVes the impression that Women can actual1y help themselVes and be proactiVe against cancer , The actual results indicate it is a Very poor method of screening , picking up less than 5% of all breast cancers as current1y performed by most Women. For Women of this age group and for older Women With dense breasts , there has been no solution to the problem of early diagnosis and treatment , so a formula and method of de1iVery of a medicated formu1a is needed for ear1y interVention and preVention of breast diseases. [ 0042 ] These are the mil1ions of Women Who do not Wish to get annual mammography for fear of the radiation and fear of chemotherapy , surgery , and radiation. In fact , a recent Medi - ca1 Meeting of consu1tants and OB / GYN meeting a UCSF , haVe suggested that a Woman get no more than 10 Mammograms in her lifetime. [ 0043 ] A recent National Cancer Institute study conﬂrmed an increased risk of breast cancer among Women getting annua1 mammography. There is a large group of Women concerned about this risk of mammography and risk of breast cancer , and a medicated formula is needed for early interVention and preVention of breast cancer , and since , based on many years of research by the author of this patent , there is a WindoW of 8 to 10 years Where breast cancer is “dormant , ” With breast cells still mutating or still precancerous , and a progression to breast cancer and metastasis may be preVented on ear1y interVention , based on many years of research by the author of this patent. In addition , there may be an opportunity to remediate local toxins in the breast that are carcinogenic. 1. This is a method of treating and preVenting breast cancer and breast disease in men , Women or animals , With a formula and a means of deliVery of the formula that can be used as a topical , intraducta1 , ducta1 , intraducta1 infusion , injectab1e , subcutaneous , or other means of de1iVery that consists of a formula that creates repair , or cellular - enVironmental , pericellular homeostasis in the region of the breast and surrounding tissue. This formula and method of its deliVery is to treat abnormal breast tissue or other region of the body to be treated , or to preVent the formation of cancer or precursors to cancer or atypia or other form of abnorma1 breast or other tissue before it spreads or becomes breast cancer and causes metastasis to the brain , liVer , bone and other parts of the body.
