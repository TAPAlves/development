This rod p10. jects out thi ough the front of the boiler a11d is pro1ided With an adjusting Wheel 4O b1 means of Which the damper maV be 10cked to close the air opening enti1elV , or regulate its size according tc dier1ent conditions. It is important in an apparatus of this 11ind to pro - peer proportion the air and. . steam suppr , that is , if steam of a certain ' pressure and VelocitV is del - iVered to the coil. and . the nozsle therein then a certain amount of air should be supplied to the noa zle to obtain the best combusticn. BV means of this dampe1 I can regulate the air suppr to a nicetV , and deliVer - a suitable Volume to the steam nozzles to meet all requirements. In the operation of the app a1 atus the steam ﬁoW 111g through the coil 11 - il1 be di s— charged 1n jets to meet the pr oducts of cm 11 - bustion and With a suitable suppr of ai1 combustion Will take place sometimes c1ose to the steam jets and often at a considerable distance therefrom , depending upon the flo11 of the smoke and products of. combustion 111 the chamber. The 1§nees and the steam coil maV eXpand and contract f1‘ eelV Without 111 - terfering With one a‘nothe1 and there Will be no obstruction of the steam jets due to the change of position of the holes 1n the pi pe in the eXpansion and contr action the1 ein. i he coil can be re adilV remoV ed to ciean out the. holes or for anV other ' _pu ' rpose and When - . . eVer desired the lrnees maV be reVersed to. present a neW surface t0 the ﬁre. _.
