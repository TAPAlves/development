There were eight ( 8 ) treatment groups. [ 0040 ] On day 42 of the study , the feed was withdrawn from the broi|ers , and the broiiers were immediately weighed. After a minimum of 6 hours fo||owing withdrawal of feed , b|ood was col|ected from the braohia| vein from 3 broi|ers per pen , and p|aced in 12 X 75 mm polypropy|ene tubes. B|ood was plaoed on ice immediate|y after co||ection to prevent compositionai ohanges prior to de|ivery to the |aboratory for processing. B|ood was centrifuged for separation of serum , and p|aced in microfuge tubes for shipment to Marshﬁeid Laboratories for determination of cho|esterol ooncentration.
