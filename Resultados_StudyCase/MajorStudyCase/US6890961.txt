DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION , PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. The f0ll0Wing speciﬁcati0n sets f0rth the preferred emb0diments 0f the present inVenti0n. The emb0diments 0f. 5. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 2. the inVenti0n disc10sed herein are the best m0des c0ntem - p1ated by the inVent0rs f0r carrying 0ut their inVenti0n in a c0mmercial enVir0nment , alth0ugh it sh0uld be underst00d that Vari0us m0diﬁcati0ns can be acc0mplished Within the parameters 0f the present inVenti0n. A principa1 ingredient in the f0rmu1ati0ns 0f the present inVenti0n is B - car0tene. As is kn0Wn [ 3 - car0tene is a naturally 0ccurring pr0duct and is c0nsidered a precurs0r t0 Vitamin A. [ 3 - car0tene is aVai1able fr0m seVera1 c0mmercia1 s0urces , usual1y as a suspensi0n in an edible 0r n0n - t0Xic 0i1. The [ 3 - car0tene that is used in the f0rmulati0ns 0f the present inVenti0n is purchased fr0m a c0mmercial source ( R0che ) . It is itself a f0rmulati0n c0ntaining 30 percent ( % ) by Weight 0f B - car0tene partic1es suspended in Vegetable 0il. The particles 0f [ 3 - car0tene in this c0mmercial pr0duct are 0f 10 micr0ns 0r smaller size. All percentages pr0Vided in the present descripti0n are 0n a Weight - by - Weight basis , unless stated 0therWise. An0ther imp0rtant 0r principa1 c0mp0nent 0f the f0rmulati0ns 0f the present inVenti0n is a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant 0r emulsifying agent , the preferred eXamples 0f Which are p0lyeth0Xylated cast0r 0il and POE ( 20 ) s0rbitan m0n001eate ( aVai1able under the c0mmercia1 name P01ys0rbate 80 G1yc0sperse , O - 20 ) . P0lyeth0Xylated cast0r 0il is als0 aVailable fr0m seVeral c0mmercial s0urces. The p0lyeth0Xylated cast0r 0il pr0duct utilized in the preferred emb0diments 0f the f0rmu1ati0ns 0f the present inVenti0n is 0btained fr0m BASF Aktiengese11schaft , Germ any under the tradenames CREMOPHOR EL and RH - 40. P0lys0rbates and p0ly0Xyethylene stearates are eXamples f0r 0ther emulsifying agents 0r surfactants Which can be utilized in the f0rmu1ati0ns and meth0ds 0f the present inVenti0n instead 0f p01yeth0Xy1ated cast0r 0i1. These 0ther surfactants can a1s0 be used in c0mbinati0n With 0ne an0ther and 0r in c0mbinati0n With p0lyeth0Xylated cast0r 0il. A functi0n 0f the surfactant 0r emulsifying agents , such as p0lyeth0Xylated cast0r 0il 0r POE ( 20 ) sorbitan m0n001eate 0f the present1y preferred emb0diments , is t0 stabilize in mice11es and thereby s0lubilize the B - car0tene. With0ut micellizati0n [ 3 - car0tene W0uld be ins0luble and c0uld 0nly be suspended as particles in the aque0us medium 0f the f0rmulati0n. Sti11 an0ther imp0rtant 0r principal c0mp0nent 0f the f0rmu1ati0ns 0f the present inVenti0n is a Water miscib1e and pharmaceuticaﬂy acceptable p01y0l , the preferred eXamp1e 0f Which is glycer0l. An eXample f0r an alternatiVe t0 glycer0l is diethylene glyc0l. The Water miscible , pharmaceutica1ly acceptab1e p01y01 acts as an emulsifying 0r s01u - bi1izing agent and a1s0 increases the Visc0sity 0f the f0rmu - 1ati0ns 0f the inVenti0n. The 0ther pharmaceutica1ly acceptable p0ly0l , such as diethylene glyc0l , can be used in c0mbinati0n With still an0ther acceptable p0ly0l , 0r in c0mbinati0n With glycer0l. Generally speaking , Where m0re than 0ne chemica1 c0mp0und 0r substance 0f a certain genera1 categ0ry ( such as surfactant , p01y0l , preserVatiVe , ﬁaV0ring agent etc. ) can be utilized in the present inVenti0n , then instead 0f a single such c0mp0und 0r substance a c0mbinati0n 0f substances falling Within the same general categ0ry can a1s0 be used. U. S. Pat. N0. 4 , 572 , 915 , already menti0ned ab0Ve in the intr0duct0ry secti0n 0f the present applicati0n f0r patent , describes clear aque0us f0rmulati0ns 0f fat s0luble Vitamins and nutriti0nal supplements , and a certain f0rmulati0n c0n - taining B - car0tene. T0 the eXtent U. S. Pat. N0. 4 , 572 , 915 disc10ses inf0rmati0n regarding s0urces f0r , and / 0r a1ternatiVes 0f certain c0mp0nents Which are utilized in the present inVenti0n and als0 in the pr0ducts 0f U. S. Pat.

US 6 , 890 , 961 B2. 3. is useful for the practice of the present inVention and is eXpress1y incorporated herein by reference. Afurther important component of the formulations of the present inVention is an ester of an unsaturated fatty acid , the preferred eXamp1e of Which is ethyl lino1eate. The ethy1 lino1eate acts as a solubilizing agent. Another component in the formulations of the present inVention is d - a1pha - tocophero1 ( Vitamin E ) or a pharmaceutica1ly acceptable deriVatiVe of d - alpha - tocophero1 haVing Vitamin E actiVity. d - alpha - tocopherol or a deriVatiVe haVing Vitamin E actiVity is not an essential component , but its inclusion is highly adVantageous because it serVes as a source of Vitamin E and also as a natura1 , pharmaceutical1y acceptable anti - oXidant. Instead of Vitamin E or its deriVatiVe other pharmaceutically acceptable and preferably naturally occurring anti - oXidants can also be used in the formu - 1ations of the present inVention. EXamp1es for other suitable anti - oXidants are rosemary eXtract ( a natural product ) , butylated hydroXtmethyl phenol ( BHA ) and ascorbic acid ( Vitamin C ) . Vitamin A pa1mitate or other pharmaceutical1y acceptab1e form of Vitamin A is sti11 another optiona1 component of the formulation of the present inVention. Still other components or ingredients Which are adVantageous1y inc1uded in the clear mice11ized B - carotene formu - 1ations of the present inVention are described in connection With the description of the tWo main preferred forms of the formulation , namely a gel adapted for oral administration to leukoplakia affected areas in the oral caVity , and a mouth Wash or ora1 rinse , again adapted for treatment of leuko - p1akia in the ora1caVity. The mouth Wash or ora1 rinse of the present inVention can also be utilized as a soothing rinse by persons Who are not affected by leukoplakia. Gel Formulation.

Although inclusion of the ﬁaVoring agents , sWeeteners and chelating agents , such as disodium EDTA , are not. US 6 , 890 , 961 B2. 5. essential in the oral rinse formulation of the present inVention , these components are adVantageous because they help to proVide and maintain palatability , non - turbid appearance and a reasonab1e she1f - 1ife to the ora1 rinse of the inVention. Simi1arly , the preserVatiVes and antibacterials included in the ora1 rinse are not absolute1y necessary for the oral rinse to function for its intended purposes of acting as a soothing oral rinse and / or treating or preVenting deVelopment of ora1 lesions and 1eukop1akia , but are highly adVantageous for proViding and maintaining a reasonable she1f - 1ife. The antibacterial agents and the Vitamin A in the ora1 rinse formulation also proVide additional beneﬁts to the user , Whether the rinse is used to treat or preVent lesions or just as a soothing ora1 rinse. EXamp1es of anti - bacteria1 agents other than the cety1pyridinium chloride of the preferred embodiments are benzalkonium chloride , methylbenzethonium chloride and chlorheXidine gluconate. The anti - foam agent included in the oral rinse composition of the present inVention preVents undesired foaming. Such anti - foam agents that are accepted in the pharmaceutical and food - related industry are Well knoWn in the art and are aVailable commercially from Various sources and usually contain si1icone compounds. An eXamp1e is the We11knoWn commercia1ly aVailable Antifoam A Compound of DoW Corning , that is itse1f a formulation and not a sing1e chemical compound. Apreferred range of the components of the oral rinse is as fo11oWs : . deionized or distil1ed Water 70 to 95% ; . glycerol ( or equiValent polyol , as described aboVe ) 2 to 7% ; . crystalline Xylitol ( or other equiValent sWeetener ) 2 to 7% ; . ﬁaVoring agent , such as natura1 spearmint ﬁaVor in combination of a11 ﬁaVors , 0.2 to 1.5% ; . ethoXylated castor oil ( or equiValent surfactant as described aboVe ) 0.01 to 1% ; . sodium benzoate ( or other preserVatiVe ) 0.01 to 0.5% ; . cety1 pyridinium chloride ( or other pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e anti - bacteria1 agent ) 0.01 to 1% ; . B - carotene 30% by - Weight suspension in edible oil 0.01 to 2% by Weight , thus containing 0.003 to 0.60 by Weight of actual B - carotene ; . ethy1 1ino1eate ( or equiVa1ent unsaturated fatty acid ester ) 0.01 to 0.5% ; . disodium EDTA or other pharmaceutically acceptable chelating agent , 0.005 to 0.05% ; . d - alpha - tocopherol ( Vitamin E ) in a composition containing 1300 IU per gram ( or equiValent antioXidant ) 0.004 to 0.8% by Weight ; . Vitamin A palmitate in a composition containing 17 mm IU per gram , or other pharmaceutically acceptable deriVatiVe of Vitamin A , haVing Vitamin A actiVity , 0.001 to 0.3% ; . a pharmaceutica1ly acceptab1e anti - foam agent 0.0005—0.01%. A presently preferred eXemplary embodiment of the oral rinse of the present inVention has the folloWing composition. deionized Water 88.95% ; . g1ycero1 5.1% ; . crysta1line Xylito1 5.0% ; . natural spearmint ﬁaVor 0.50% ; . natural Veltol ﬁaVor 0.20% ; . ethoXylated castor oil 0.090% ; . sodium benzoate 0.06% ; . cetyl pyridinium ch1oride 0.0532% ; . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 6. ethyl linoleate 0.01500% ; . disodium EDTA 0.010% ; . d - alpha - tocopherol in a composition containing 1300 IU per gram 0.00885% by Weight ; . Vitamin Apalmitate in a composition containing 1.7 mm IU per gram 0.0055% ; . a pharmaceutically acceptable anti - foam agent 0.001%. Additional ingredients or components such as more or different ﬁaVoring agents , sWeeteners , coloring agents and additional Vitamins ( Water or fat soluble ) may become apparent to those skil1ed in the art for inclusion both in the gel and oral rinse formulations of the present inVention , Without departing from the scope and spirit of the inVention and Without adVerse1y affecting the abi1ity of the formulations to treat leukop1akia. It should also be understood in connection With the herein listed ranges of percentages of the components , that it is not contemplated Within the scope of the inVention to haVe all or most of the ingredients present in their respectiVe maXimum listed range in any giVen composition , as such a composition Would be incapable of eXistence for haVing more than 100% of the sum of its components. Rather , it is contemplated that When one or more ingredients are in their maXimum range , then the ratios of other components are in less than their maXimum range , so that the sum total of al1 components ( listed or not listed aboVe ) is 100%. Preparation of the Gel Formulation. It is important for the B - carotene to be so1ubilized and dispersed in the formulations in a mice11ized form , because this actiVe ingredient of the aqueous formulations of the inVention is absorbed and is substantially effectiVe only When it is micellized. Although the micelle size of B - carotene in the formulations of the present inVention has not been actua1ly measured , measurements of someWhat analogous micellized products described in U. S. Pat. No. 4 , 572 , 915 indicated that the micelles are of approXimately 2 microns or smaller. As it is Well appreciated by those skilled in the art , c1arity of the so1ution or ge1 indicates comp1ete mice11ization Whereas turbidity may indicate that the B - carotene is dispersed in particles larger than 2 micron micelless. The ensuing general description discloses a process for preparing or manufacturing the gel formulation of the present inVention in such a manner that the resu1t is a c1ear mice11ized ge1 suitab1e for treating 1eukop1akia in the manner described below General Description of the Process of Preparing the Gel Formulation of the InVention : . The B - carotene in Vegetab1e oi1 ( 30% actiVe ingredient , obtained from Roche ) is miXed With po1yethoXy1ated castor oil , or With POE ( 20 ) sorbitan monooleate and heated under agitation to approXimately 160 to 180° C. , and the heating and agitation is continued until a clear homogenous albeit co1ored so1ution is obtained. Then , Whi1e sti1l being agitated the solution is coo1ed to approXimate1y 130 to 135° C. Whi1e d - alpha - tocopherol , glycerol and ethyl linoleate are added. Optionally Vitamin A palmitate can also be added in this step. These three or four components themselVes are at room or ambient temperature before they are added , and the addition is conducted at such a rate under continuous agitation that the temperature drops to and is maintained , if necessary by heating , at approXimately 85 to 90° C. Agitating in this temperature range is continued until a clear and homogeneous so1ution is obtained. Thereafter , Water itself heated to approXimately 60° C. and optiona1ly potassium.

Methods of Using the Formu1ations of the InVention. The oral rinse formu1ation of the present inVention is best used by rinsing the mouth With approXimately 10 to 15 ml of the liquid rinse for approXimately one minute or longer , tWice a day or more frequent1y , as may be recommended by dentist or physician. Besides haVing a p1easant soothing and anti - bacterial effect , repetitiVe use frequently diminishes further deVelopment of mouth irritation and is eXpected to forestal1 or minimize the deVe1opment of 1eukoplakia. The gel formulation of the present inVention is to be. applied directly to the oral lesion ( leukoplakia ) preferably Via a cotton app1icator ( Q - tip ) . Typica11y a dab of the ge1 sufﬁcient to substantially coVer the lesion is used in a sing1e application to a sing1e lesion. ApproXimately 5 minutes after application the mouth is to be rinsed With Warm tap Water. The gel is to be applied tWice a day to the oral lesion , or more frequent1y , as recommended by physician. C1inical Results An open labe1 c1inical trial Was carried out on 11 consenting patients With eXtensiVe disease consistent With the diagnosis of oral leukoplakia. All patients presented With potentially cancerous pre - malignant lesions , Which Were bi - dimensiona11y measurab1e. A baseline biopsy Was taken to ru1e out the presence of inVasiVe cancer. At the time of enrollment , the patients Were not being treated With oral beta - carotene or With retinoids. . . Characteristics Number of Patients Age ( s ) Males 2 72 and 73 Females 9 range 31—81 ( mean 59 ) . . The drug used in this study Was the c1ear , transparent mice11ized ge1 formu1ation of EXample 1 , as speciﬁcal1y described in the preferred embodiments. Treatment consisted in the topical application of approXimately one milliliter of the gel to the oral lesion Via a cotton app1icator ( Q - tip ) , FiVe minutes after app1ication , the patient rinsed her / his mouth With Warm tap Water. Each patient Was treated tWice daily for three months. Results by the end of the three - month period of treatment Were as folloWs : . . Number of Patients ObserVed effect. . 2 leukoplakia disappeared completely 6 leukoplakia decreased by 75% 3 leukoplakia decreased by 50%. . In no patient did the lesion fail to decrease by less than 50%. The gel formulations of the present inVention are considered ideal agents for the treatment of pre - malignant lesions in the ora1 caVity , since this topical route deposits a high concentration of the effectiVe agent B - carotene at its site of action , While resulting only in minimal degree of systematic absorption. MoreoVer , the gel is an ideal Vehicle for topical application in the mouth , and because the B - carotene is mice1lized in the ge1 of the inVention its absorption is great1y increased re1atiVe to a non - mice11ized preparation.
