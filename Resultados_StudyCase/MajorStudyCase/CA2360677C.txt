ANT ICONVULSAN T DERIVATIVES USEFUL m TREATING BULIMIA NERVOSA. BACKGROUND 0F THE INVENTION. Compounds of Formula ( I ) : x CH2OS02NHR1 R5QR2 R4 R3 ( I ) . are structurally novel antiepi1eptic comp0unds that are highly effective anticonvulsants in animal tests ( Maryan0ff , B. E , Nortey , S. O. , Gar / iocki , J . F. , Shank , RR and Dodgson , S. P. J. Med. Chem. gg 880 - 887 , 1987 ; Maryanoff , B. E. , Costanzo , M. J. , Shank , R. P. , Schupsky , J . J . , Ortegon , M. E. , and Vaught J. L. Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 3 , 2653 - 26S6 , 1993 ) . These compounds are covered by US Patent No. 4 , 513 , 006. One of these compounds 2 , 3 : 4 , 5 - bis - O - ( 1 - methyIethylidene ) - B - D - ﬁ ' uct0pyranose sulfamate known as topiramate has been demonstrated in clinica1 trials of human epilepsy t0 be effcctive as adjunctive therapy or as m0notherapy in treating simple and complex partial seizures and secondarily generalized seizures ( E. FAUGHT , B. J. WILDER , R. E. RAMSEY , R. A. REIFE , L D. KRAMER , G. W. PLEDGER , R. M. KARIM et. al. , Epilepsia w 33 , 1995 ; S. K. SACI - IDBO , R. C. SACHDEO , R. A. REIFE , P. LIM and G. PLEDGER , Epilepsia M 33 , 1995 ) , and is currently marketed for the treatment of simple and complex partial seizure epi1epsy with or without secondary genera1ized seizures in appr0ximately twenty c0untries including the United States , and app1ications for regu1at0ry appr0val are present1y pending in several additional countrics through0ut. the wor1d. Compounds of F0rrnula ( I ) were initia11y i ' 0und to possess anticonvulsant activity. in the. 10. 15. 20. CA 02360677 2005 - 01 - l9. traditi0na1 maximal electr0shock seizure ( MES ) test in mice ( SHANK , R. P. , GARDOCKI , J. F. , VAUGHT , J. L , DAVIS , C. B. , SCHUPSKY , J. J. , RAFFA , R. B. , DODGSON , S. J. , NORTEY , S. O. , and MARYANOFF , B. E. , Epilepsia §_5_ 450 - 460 , 1994 ) . Subsequent studies revealed that Compounds of F 0nnu1a ( I ) were a1so high1y effective in the MES test in rats. More recently t0piramate was found to effectively bl0ck seizures in severa1 r0dent m0dels 0f epilepsy ( J. NAKAMURA , S. TAMURA , T. KANDA , A. ISHII , K. ISHIHARA , T. SERlKAWA , J. YAMADA , and M. SASA , Eur. J. Pharmac0l. 2.53 83 - 89 , 1994 ) , and in an anima1 m0de1 of kindled epilepsy ( A. WAUQUIER and S. ZHOU , Epilepsy Res. 2& , 73—77 , 1996 ) . Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent epis0des 0f binge eating associated with inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent Weight gain ( Diagnostic Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association 1Vth Edition ) . It is more c0mmon in fema1es than ma1es ; self evaluation is undu1y inﬂuenced by b0dy shape and weight and. cccurs in pers0ns with high rates 0f m0od and impulse 00ntr01 dis0rders.

It has been suggested that variations in brain GABA metab0lism may be inv0lved in the control of f0od intake in rats and that experimental brain GABA elevati0n pr0duced anorexia in adult fema1e rats ( Coscina DV , GABA and feeding : reversal of overeating by central GABA - transaminase inhibition , Progress in Neuro - Psych0pharmacol0gy & Bio10gical Psychiatry , 7 ( 4 - 6 ) : 463 - 7 , 1983 ) . It has also been shown that end0genous latera1 hypothalamic g1utamate acts t0 regu1ate natura1 eating and body weight in rats ( Stanley BG , Wi1lett VL 3"‘ , Donias HW , Dee MG 2“° , Duva MA , Lateral hypothalamic NMDA receptors and glutamate as physiological mediators of eating and weight contr0l , American J0urna1 0f Physi01ogy , 270 ( 2Pt 2 ) : R443 - 9 , l996 Feb. ) Based on the known enhancement 0f brain GABA activity and rcduced glutamate receptor activity of t0piramate , we hyp0thesize that there is potentia1 efficacy of. topiramatc in the treatment of bu1imia. For treating bu1imia , a compound 0f formula ( I ) may be employed at a t0tal dai1y dosage in the range of ab0ut 15 mg to ab0ut 500 mg , preferably , about 16 mg t0 about 200 mg , for an average adult human , administered 0ne to f0ur times per day , preferab1y , 0ne to two times per day. A unit dose typically contains ab0ut 16 t0 ab0ut 300 mg , preferab1y , about 16 to ab0ut 200 mg , of the active ingredient. 0ptima1 dosages to be administered may be readily determined by th0se ski11ed in the art , and wi11 vary with the particu1ar comp0und used , the mode of administrati0n , the strength 0f the preparation , the m0de 0f administration , and the advancement of the disease 00ndition. In additi0n , factors ass0ciatcd with the particular patient being. treated , including patient age , weight , diet and time of administration , wi11 result in the. need to adjust dosages. To prepare the pharmaceutical 00mp0siti0ns 0f this invention , 0ne or more sulfamate 00mp0unds 0f formu1a ( I ) are intimate1y admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according t0 00nventional pharmaceutica1 compounding techniques , which carrier may. take a wide variety of forms depending on the f0rm of preparation desired for. 6. CA 02360677 200l - 07 - 30. WO 00 / 44374 PCTfUS00 / 02334. administration , e. g. , oral , by suppository , or parenteral. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage f0rm , any 0f the usual pharmaceutical media may be emp1oyed. Thus , for 1iquid ora1preparati0ns , such as for examp1e , suspensi0ns , e1ixirs and s01uti0ns , suitab1e carriers and additives include water , g1yco1s , oils , a1c0h0ls , ﬂavoring agents , preservatives , 001oring agents and the 1ike ; for so1id 0ral preparati0ns such as , f0r examp1e , powders , capsules and tab1ets , suitab1e carriers and additives include starches , sugars , diluents , granulating agents , 1ubricants , bindcrs , disintegrating agents and the like. Because 0f their ease in administration , tab1ets and capsules represent the most advantageous ora1 d0sage unit f0rm , in which case solid pharmaceutica1 carriers are obviously empl0yed. If desired , tab1ets may be sugar coated or enteric 008ted by standard techniques. Suppositories may be prepared , in which case cccoa butter could be used as the can ' ier. F0r parenterals , the carrier will usually comprise sterile water , though other ingredients , for example , for purposes such as aiding so1ubi1ity or f0r preservation , may be included. Injectable solutions may a1so be prepared in which case appropriate stabilizing agents may be emp1oyed. T0piramate is currently availab1e for 0ra1 administration in r0und tablets containing 25 mg , 100 mg 0r 200 mg of active agent. The tablets contain the foI1owing inactive ingredients : 18ctose hydr0us , prege1atinized starch , microcrysta1line cellul0se , sodium starch g1yc0late , magnesium stearate , puriﬁed water , carnauba wax , hydr0xypropy1 methy1cellu1ose , titanium. dioxide , po1yethy1ene glyco1 , synthctic ir0n oxide , and polysorbate 80. The pharmaceutica1 compositions herein will 00ntain , per dosage unit , e. g. , tab1et , capsu1e , p0wder inj ecti0n , teasp00nful , suppository and the 1ike fr0m ab0ut 25 to about 200 mg of the active ingredient. The following Examples are set forth to aid in the understanding 0f the invention , and are not. intended and should not be c0nstrued to limit in any way the invention set f0rth in the claims which fol1ow thereafter. EXAMPLE 1. Patient 01 : Patient started topiramate at a dose 0f 25 mg qhs and titrated by 25 mg / week to a d0se 0f 100 mg / day. Within 1 month , patient had st0pped bingeing for 2 weeks ( had been bingeing daily ) and felt control over her eating. After 5 months , . 7. CA 02360677 200l - 07 - 30. WO 00 / 44374 PCT / US00 / 02334. paticnt was sti11bingeing and purging less , but has parasthesia so the timing of her topiramate was adjusted to try and relieve this. She has not 10st weight although not gained either in spite 0f increased activity. She had run out 0f topiramate 1 week prior t0 this appointment and her m0od had sharp1y deteri0rated. We11butrin was added at this visit. Three weeks later , patient was feeling we11 , 00ntinued beneﬁt t0 her bulimia , and parasthesias have res0lved with t0piramate 100 mg qd d0sing. EXAMPLE 2. Patient 02 : Patient started topiramate 25 mg qhs and titrated by 25 mg / week to dose of 100 mg / day. At first visit , she was purging 3 times / day t0 3 times / week. After 3 weeks ( topiramate 75 mg / hs ) , she is now satisﬁed when she eats smal1 amounts of food and has not over - eaten 0r fe1t guilty or purges. After 3 months , patient has 10st weight , is ' sleeping we1l and energetic. No adverse effects on 100 mg qhs. EXAMPLE 3. Patient 03 : Patient very depressed , th0ughts of suicide for years , currently on topiramate and has been purging less than 1 / day which is a decrease. At this visit , increased topiramate to 100 mg qhs ( not sure what dose was before this ) as seems to have decreased purging. Tw0 weeks 1ater , patient is more depressed , sedated and purging m0re ; changing depressi0n medicines now. Two days later , patient presents urgent1y as throwing up uncontro1lab1y due to stress and apprehensi0n. Patient a1so has migraines which cause emesis. Patient admitted t0 hospita1 for 4 days.
