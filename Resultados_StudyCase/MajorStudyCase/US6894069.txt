METHOD FOR TREATING PERINATAL ASPHYXIA IN A HUMAN OR ANIMAL NEONATE. The present inVenti0n relates t0 pharmaceutical c0mp0 - siti0ns that can be used t0 preVent and / 0r treat , in neWb0rn babies the effects 0f c0mplicati0ns that may 0ccur during childbirth. In particu1ar , the inVenti0n relates t0 pharmaceutica1 preparati0ns that can be used t0 preVent and / 0r treat , in neWb0rn babies , the effects 0f perinatal asphyXia ( =hyp0Xiaischemia ) . Speciﬁcally , the inVenti0n relates t0 pharmaceutical preparati0ns that can be used t0 preVent and / 0r treat in neWb0rn babies , brain damage 0r brain injury that may result fr0m c0mplicati0ns during childbirth such as perinatal asphyXia and / 0r hyp0Xia - ischemia. It is enVisaged that the preparati0ns 0f the inVenti0n may als0 be used f0r Veterinary purp0ses , e. g. t0 preVent and / 0r treat the effects 0f c0mplicati0ns—such as th0se menti0ned ab0Ve—that may 0ccur during the birth 0f any animal. F0r instance , it is kn0Wn that up t0 20% 0f y0ung liVest0ck bef0re the age 0f Weaning may die fr0m asphyXiati0n. Thus , in an0ther aspect , the inVenti0n may pr0Vide suitab1e Veterinary preparati0ns. It is als0 enVisaged that the inVenti0n may be used t0 preVent and / 0r treat , in pe0ple 0f all ages , the c0mplicati0ns and ( after - ) effects that cccur during result fr0m f0r instance brain ce11 injury. Thus , in yet an0ther aspect , the inVenti0n als0 pr0Vides suitable pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0ns f0r the treatment 0f such c0mplicati0ns and / 0r ( after - ) effects. Perinatal asphyXia is a seri0us c0mplicati0n 0f childbirth Which affects ab0ut 1% 0f neWb0rns W0r1d - Wide. It may lead t0 hyp0Xia - ischemia 0r m0re general1y t0 injury t0 the baby due t0 lack 0f ( sufﬁcient ) 0Xygen. The incidence 0f str0ke in the Western W0rld is 127 per 100 , 000. In particular at risk 0f such damage is the brain. F0r instance , hyp0Xia - ischemia during chi1dbirth may resu1t in ne0nata1 encepha10pathy , cerebra1pa1sy , menta1 retardati0n , learning disabilities , epilepsy 0r 0ther long - term effects. F0r a large part , these effects are caused by eXcessiVe f0rmati0n 0f free radicals such as super0Xide and hydr0Xyl radicals. These radica1s are especia1ly f0rmed directly after a peri0d 0f hyp0Xia - ischemia When re0Xygenati0n and reperfusi0n are re - established. T0gether With NO ( nitric 0Xide ) super - 0Xide reacts t0 per0Xynitrite , Which attacks the brain cell membranes , resulting in lipid per0Xidati0n and eVentually ce11 death. It has been suggested in the art t0 preVent 0r treat the ab0Ve effects by administering t0 ne0nates that are at risk , free radical scaVengers and / 0r Xanthine 0Xidase inhibit0rs such as a1l0purin0l ( “ALLO” ) 0r n0n - pr0tein b0und ir0n che1at0rs such as defer0Xamine ( “DFO” ) . In a pi10t study in neWb0rn babies and in eXperimenta1 studies it has been sh0Wn that all0purin0l and defer0Xamine reduce fee radicalinduced brain damage in neWb0rns t0 s0me eXtend , these c0mp0unds , h0WeVer , are still n0t fully satisfact0ry. Since eXcessiVe bi0synthesis 0f NO resu1ts in perinata1 destructi0n 0f neur0ns , the use 0f nitric 0Xide synthase inhibit0rs seems t0 be pr0mising in reducing brain injury after perinata1 hyp0Xia - ischemia. HOWeVer , data c0ncerning n0n - speciﬁc NOS inhibit0rs after hyp0Xia - ischemia are c0n - ﬁicting : f0r instance it has been sh0Wn that NG - nitr0 - L - arginine ( NNLA ) c0mpr0mised cerebra1 energy status dur - . 5. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 2. r0pr0tectiVe in ne0natal rats ( Palmer et a1. , Pediatric Res. 41 ( 1997 ) 294A ) . NOWadays , three types 0f NOS is0f0rms haVe been characterised : neur0nal , inducible and end0thelia1 NOS. Using selectiVe NOS inhibit0rs and transgenic ani - ma1s it has been suggested that the NOS is0f0rm determines Whether it acts neur0pr0tectiVe 0r neur0t0Xic up0n HI ( B01a n0s and A1meida , Bi0chim. Bi0phys. Acta 1411 ( 1999 ) , 415—436 ) . J0hnst0n et al ( Semin. Ne0mztal. 2000 ( 5 ) : 75—86 ) sh0Wed that 7 - nitr0indaz0le , mainly a neur0nal NOS inhibi - t0r but 0n1y injectab1e intra - perit0neal1y , Was effectiVe in reducing ap0pt0sis and reducing the 1eVe1s 0f citru11ine. Higuchi et al ( Eur. J. Pharmac0l0gy 342 ( 1998 ) 47—49 ) and Tsuji et al ( PediarriC Res 47 ( 2000 ) , 79—83 ) rep0rted that amin0guanidine , mainly an inducible NOS inhibit0r , reduced infarct V01umes in ne0nata1 rats. On the 0ther hand , end0thelial NOS kn0ck - 0ut mice Were highly sensitiVe t0 cerebral ischemia , suggesting a r0le f0r eNOS in cerebral perfusi0n. NOS inhibit0rs With p0tentia1 usefulness in reducing brain injury after perinata1 HI need t0 be Water s0luble f0r rapid intraVen0us injecti0n in m0ther 0r neWb0rn child / animal and need t0 be transp0rted t0 the brain and be se1ectiVe inhibitiVe f0r neur0na1 and inducib1e NOS. Until n0W n0 accepted therapy is aVailable f0r asphyXiated infants. Theref0re , there is a need f0r pharmaceutical preparati0ns that may be used t0 preVent and / 0r treat , in neWb0rn babies , the effects 0f c0mp1icati0n that may 0ccur during childbirth. In additi0n , as already menti0ned ab0Ve , there is als0 a need f0r Veterinary preparati0ns that can be used f0r the same 0r similar purp0ses is neWb0rn animals. Als0 , there is a need f0r pharmaceutica1 preparati0ns that can be used t0 preVent and / 0r treat ( the effects 0f ) brain cell injury in pe0p1e 0f all ages. Acc0rding t0 the present inVenti0n , it has been f0und that 2 - imin0bi0tin and 0ther speciﬁc neur0nal and inducible NOS inhibit0rs , can be used t0 preVent and / 0r treat the ab0Ve - menti0ned effects. In particular , in in ViV0 studies inV0lVing piglets ( Vide the EXperimental Part bel0W ) , it Was f0und that 2 - imin0bi0tin is m0re effectiVe in preVenting and / 0r treating these effects than either all0purin0l and / 0r defer0Xamine , e. g. ab0ut 60% m0re effectiVe then p1aceb0 treatment and ab0ut 25% m0re effectiVe than treatment With all0purin01 and / 0r defer0Xamine. Theref0re , the NOS inhibit0rs t0 be used acc0rding t0 the present inVenti0n sh0uld be capable 0f inhibiting neur0na1 NOS ( nNOS=brain NOS ) , as Well as inducible NOS ( iNOS ) . HOWeVer , the NOS inhibit0r sh0uld n0t signiﬁcant1y inhibit end0thelial NOS ( eNOS ) . Speciﬁca1ly , the inhibiting effects 0n nNOS and 0n iNOS sh0uld c0rresp0nd t0 an inhibit0ry c0ncentrati0n IC50 0f 150 MM 0r loWer , preferably 50 #M 0r loWer , Whereas the inhibiting effect 0n eNOS , if any , sh0u1d c0rresp0nd t0 an inhibit0ry c0ncentrati0n IC50 0f 250 11M 0r higher , preferably 500 MM 0r higher. In particular the inhibit0ry c0ncentrati0n 0f either nNOS 0r iNOS 0r b0th sh0uld be at least a fact0r 5 , preferably at least a fact0r 50 lOWer than the inhibit0ry c0ncentrati0n 0n eNOS. The inhibit0r is preferably high1y soluble in aque0us medium. In general the s0lubility sh0uld be such that a pr0phylactically 0r therapeutically effectiVe am0unt 0f the inhibit0r is s0luble in 100 ml 0r less , preferably in 50 ml 0r less aque0us medium f0r neWb0rn babies. In particu1ar the inhibit0r has a s0lubility in aque0us medium 0f at 1east 50 Mm0l per 100 ml , preferably at least 150 Mm0l per 100 ml. It Was f0und that 2 - imin0bi0tin and 0ther nNOS , iNOS , n0n - eNOS inhibit0rs such as S - benzy1is0thi0urea , . ing and after hyp0Xia - ischemia ( Hl ) in neWb0rn pig1ets 65 L - thi0citru1ine , NG - m0n0ethy1 - L - arginine , TRIM ( 1 - ( 2 - .

Thus , in a ﬁrst general aspect , the inVenti0n relates t0 a pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0n , c0mprising a NOS inhibit0r such as 2 - imin0bi0tin 0r a pharmaceutical1y acceptable salt there0f , and 0pti0nal1y at 1east 0ne pharmaceutical1y accept - ab1e carrier , eXcipient 0r adjuVant. In a ﬁrst speciﬁc aspect , the inVenti0n relates t0 a pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0n f0r the preVenti0n and / 0r treatment in ne0nates 0f the effects 0f c0mplicati0ns during childbirth , said preparati0n c0mprising a se1ectiVe NOS inhibit0r as deﬁned ab0Ve , and 0pti0na1ly at least 0ne pharmaceutically acceptable carrier , eXcipient 0r adjuVant. In particular , this aspect 0f the inVenti0n relates t0 such a pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0n f0r the preVenti0n and / 0r treatment in ne0nates 0f the effects and c0nsequences 0f perinatal asphyXia ( =hyp0Xia - ischemia ) ; f0r the preVenti0n and / 0r treatment in ne0nates 0f brain injury 0r brain damage f0ll0Wing c0mplicati0ns during birth , including but n0t limited t0 ne0natal encephal0pathy , cerebral palsy , mental retardati0n , learning disabi1ities and epi1epsy ; and / 0r f0r the preVenti0n and / 0r treatment in ne0nates 0f a reducti0n in cerebral energy status and / 0r a reducti0n in electrical brain actiVity f0ll0Wing c0mplicati0ns during birth , lactate f0rma - ti0n ( metab01ic acid0sis ) , 10W apgar sc0ring sca1e during childbirth. In a sec0nd speciﬁc aspect the inVenti0n relates t0 the use 0f the selectiVe NOS inhibit0r , such as 2 - imin0bi0tin 0r a pharmaceutically acceptable salt there0f , in the preparati0n 0f a pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0n f0r the preVenti0n and / 0r treatment in ne0nates , 0f the effects 0f c0mp1icati0ns during childbirth as described ab0Ve. In an0ther speciﬁc aspect , the inVenti0n relates t0 a pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0n f0r the preVenti0n and / 0r treatment 0f ( the effects 0f ) brain ce1l injury in pe0p1e 0f a11 ages , said preparati0n c0mprising an inhibit0r as described ab0Ve , and 0pti0nally at least 00e pharmaceutically acceptable carrier , eXcipient 0r adjuVant , and t0 the use. Brain cell injury may be ass0ciated With f0cal ischemia , thr0mb0tic str0ke , g10ba1ischemia , neur0 - degenerati0n , infecti0ns such as meningitis , and traumatic brain injury. A150 , the inVenti0n relates t0 the use 0f 2 - imin0bi0tin 0r related selectiVe NOS inhibit0r 0r a pharmaceutically acceptable salt there0f in the preparati0n 0f a pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0n f0r the preVen - ti0n an / 0r treatment 0f ( the effects 0f ) brain ce11 injury in pe0p1e 0f a11 ages. In an0ther general aspect , the inVenti0n relates t0 a Veterinary c0mp0siti0n , said preparati0n c0mprising a selectiVe inhibit0r as described ab0Ve and 0pti0nally at least 0ne carrier , eXcipient 0r adjuVant acceptab1e f0r Veterinary pur - p0ses. In a further speciﬁc aspect , the inVenti0n relates t0 a Veterinary c0mp0siti0n f0r the preVenti0n and / 0r treatment in neWb0rn animals 0f the effects 0f c0mplicati0ns during the birth 0f such an animal , said preparati0n c0mprising the inhibit0r , and 0pti0nally at least 0ne carrier , eXcipient 0r adjuVant acceptable f0r Veterinary purp0ses and t0 their use in the preparati0n 0f a Veterinary c0mp0siti0n f0r the preVenti0n and / 0r treatment in neWb0rn animals 0f the effects 0f c0mp1icati0ns during the birth 0f such an anima1. The term “selectiVe NOS inhibit0r” in the c0nteXt 0f the present inVenti0n means a c0mp0und capable 0f inhibiting inducible nitric 0Xide synthase ( iNOS ) as Well as neur0na1 nitric 0Xide synthase ( nNOS ) but n0t 0r much less str0ngly inhibiting end0the1ial f0rm 0f nitric 0Xide synthase ( eNOS ) , as deﬁned ab0Ve. The term “c0mplicati0ns during childbirth” includes any irregularity 0r c0mplicati0n that may 0ccur—and / 0r that may haVe 0ccurred—during childbirth and that may cause. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. 65. 4. harm t0 the neWb0rn , inc1uding but n0t limited t0 th0se irregularities 0r c0mplicati0ns that may 0ccur pri0r t0 childbirth , While the baby is being b0rn , 0r sh0rtly thereafter ; and irrespectiVe 0f the cause ( s ) there0f ( e. g. With the baby itself and / 0r With the m0ther ) . In particular , the term “c0mplicati0ns during childbirth” includes any such irregularities / c0mplicati0ns that may lead t0—0r that may put the baby at risk 0f—asphyXiati0n ( =hyp0Xia , ischemia 0r generally lack 0f sufficient supp1y 0f 0Xygen t0 the baby ) and / 0r t0 any tissue 0r 0rgan 0f the baby ; and / 0r any such irregularities 0r c0mp1icati0ns that may lead t0 brain damage 0r injury in the baby 0r that put the baby at risk there0f. These may include c0mplicati0ns such as mental retardati0n , ne0nata1 encephal0pathy , learning disabilities and epilepsy. Thus , in particular , the pharmaceutical preparati0n 0f the inVenti0n may be used t0 preVent and / 0r treat in ne0nates , the effects 0f perinatal asphyXia ( =hyp0Xia - ischemia ) ; t0 preVent and / 0r treat , in ne0nates , brain injury 0r brain damage f0l10Wing c0mp1icati0ns during birth , inc1uding but n0t limited t0 ne0natal encephal0pathy , cerebral palsy , mental retardati0n , learning disabilities and epilepsy ; and / 0r t0 preVent and / 0r treat , in ne0nates , a reducti0n in cerebra1 energy status and / 0r a reducti0n in electrical brain actiVity f0ll0Wing c0mp1icati0ns during birth. With respect t0 the ab0Ve and the further discl0sure herein , it Will be clear t0 the skilled pers0n that in 0r f0r th0se aspects Wherein the inVenti0n relates t0 Veterinary preparati0ns and / 0r Veterinary uses 0f ( the c0mp0siti0ns c0ntaining ﬁr appr0priate iNOS and nNOS inhibit0r , the ab0Ve applies anal0g0usly , e. g. by reading ( neWb0rn ) animal instead 0f ( neWb0rn ) baby / child and by reading m0ther 0f the ( neWb0rn ) anima1 instead 0f m0ther 0f the ( neWb0rn ) baby 0r chi1d. The pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0ns 0f the inVenti0n are intended t0 be administered t0 neWb0rn babies , and in particular t0 ne0nates that suffer fr0m , are eXpected t0 suffer fr0m , 0r are 0therWise judged t0 be at risk fr0m the ab0Vementi0ned effects. A150 , the pharmaceutica1 c0mp0siti0n can be administered t0 the m0ther 0f the fetus , When an asphyXiated neWb0rn is eXpected. F0r the purp0ses 0f the present inVenti0n , the terms “neWb0rn baby” and “ne0nate” inc1ude babies b0rn by natural chi1dbirth as We11 as babies that haVe been de1iVered by f0r instance caesarean secti0n , and als0 include babies that haVe been b0m prematurely and / 0r the birth 0f Which has been artiﬁcially induced. The term m0ther refers t0 the m0ther 0f the fetus 0r the neWb0rn baby , inc1uding natura1 , inseminated , induced and carrier m0thers. Anal0g0usly , the Veterinary preparati0ns / c0mp0siti0ns 0f the inVenti0n are intended t0 be administered t0 neWb0rn animals , especially mammals , such as piglets , lambs , h0rses , g0ats etc. Whether any neWb0rn baby is at risk 0f any 0f the ab0Ve effects—0r m0re generally Whether treatment With the c0m - p0siti0ns 0f the inVenti0n is indicated—Will usually be determined by the clinician , taking int0 acc0unt any c0m - p1icati0ns and / 0r irregu1arities that may haVe 0ccurred sh0rtly bef0re 0r during childbirth. Babies at risk may be determined by decelerati0ns in the fetal heart rate patterns 0r in the cardi0t0c0gram ( CTG ) , mec0nium - stained anmi0tic ﬁuid , metab0lic acid0sis in micr0bl00d samples and loss 0f fetal m0Vement 0r 0ther sympt0ms kn0Wn t0 the skilled 0bstetrician. Als0 , at birth , babies subjected t0 perinata1 asphyXia may be identiﬁed by ascertaining the presence 0f ( biphasic ) changes in brain actiVity 0r brain energy leVel , f0r instance using magnetic res0nance techniques , including but.

Usually , treatment 0f a ne0nate With the c0mp0siti0ns 0f the inVenti0n Will be carried 0ut sh0rtly after chi1dbirth , e. g. during the “Wind0W” f0r therapeutic interVenti0n. Usually , this Wind0W spans the ﬁrst day f0ll0Wing childbirth , and in particu1ar the ﬁrst 3—24 h0urs f0ll0Wing childbirth. HOWeVer , if an asphyXiated baby can be eXpected , treatment Will be carried 0ut in the m0ther bef0re the eXpected lab0ur , in particular ab0ut 24 h bef0re lab0ur. As part 0f such treatment , the preparati0ns 0f the inVen - ti0n Wi1l generally be administered t0 the ne0nates in 0ne 0r m0re pharmaceutica1ly effectiVe am0unts , and in particular in 0ne 0r m0re am0unts that are effectiVe in preVenting and / 0r treating the ab0Ve - menti0ned effects. Such treatment may inV0lVe 0nly single administrati0n 0f a c0mp0siti0n 0f the inVenti0n , but usual1y—and preferab1y—inV0lVes multiple administrati0ns 0Ver seVeral h0urs 0r days , e. g. as part 0f 0r acc0rding t0 an administrati0n regimen 0r treatment regimen. Such a treatment regimen may f0r instance be as f0110Ws : eVery 4 h0urs intraVen0us1y injecti0n 0f the substance during the ﬁrst 24 h0urs. Usually , the am0unts 0f NOS inhibit0r administer t0 the ne0nate Will c0rresp0nd t0 betWeen 0.01 and 250 mg per kg b0dy Weight preferably betWeen 0.1 and 10 mg / kg. These am0unts refer t0 the actiVe c0mp0nent and d0 n0t inc1ude carrier 0r adjuVant materia1s such as carb0hydrates , lipids 0r pr0teins 0r the like , that may 0riginate fr0m the pr0ducti0n 0f the actiVe inhibit0rs 0r may be used in assisting administrati0n 0r targeting. These am0unts may be administered as a sing1e d0se 0r as mu1tip1e d0ses per day , 0r essentia11y c0ntinu0us1y 0Ver a certain peri0d 0f time , e. g. by c0ntinu - 0us infusi0n. Treatment may be c0ntinued up t0 24 h0urs after asphyXia , 0r 0therWise until the ne0nate is judged n0 lOnger t0 be at risk 0f the effects menti0ned ab0Ve. HOWeVer , the treatment , especia11y the preVentiVe treatment may als0 inV0lVe administrati0n 0f the appr0priate NOS inhibit0r t0 the m0ther bef0re 0r during partiti0n , preferably by intraVen0us injecti0n. The am0unts t0 be administered can then be the same 0r higher , depending 0n the p1acenta1 transfer and the metab0lism , the ﬁrst pass effect in the liVer and the distributi0n V0lume 0f the c0mp0und. Thus the am0unts administered t0 the m0ther may Vary betWeen e. g. 0.01—250 mg 0f actiVe c0mp0nent per kg 0f the b0dy Weight 0f the m0ther. The preparati0ns 0f the inVenti0n may c0ntain 2 - imin0bi0tin 0r 0ther suitable inhibit0rs as the free c0m - p0und 0r as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt , 0pti0nally in c0mbinati0n With 0ne 0r m0re pharmaceutically acceptable carrier , adjuVants and / 0r eXcipients.

Preferably , the pharmaceutica1 preparati0ns 0f the inVen - ti0n are administered intraVen0usly , such as by injecti0n and in particular by ( drip - ) infusi0n. Preparati0ns suitable f0r such intraVen0us administrati0n may f0r instance be prepared by miXing 2 - imin0bi0tin 0r a sa1t there0f With Water 0r a pharmaceutica1ly acceptable buffer 0r soluti0n such as n0rmal saline.

The pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0ns 0f the inVenti0n Will c0ntain the inhibit0r in a suitable am0unt , preferably as a unit d0se ; e. g. in am0unts that al10W f0r c0nVenient administrati0n 0f the d0ses indicated ab0Ve. Besides the 2 - imin0bi0tin 0r 0ther speciﬁc NOS inhibit0r , the preparati0ns 0f the inVenti0n may a1s0 c0ntain 0ne 0r m0re 0ther therapeutical1y effectiVe substances , and in particular 0ne 0r m0re actiVe substances that are suitable and / 0r intended f0r administrati0n t0 ne0nates , e. g. f0r treating and / 0r preVenting the ab0Ve and / 0r 0ther effects 0f c0mp1icati0ns during chi1dbirth.

Alth0ugh the inVenti0n is n0t 11mited t0 any speciﬁc eXplanati0n 0r mechanism , it is assumed that 2 - imin0bi0tin acts by inhibiting neur0nal and inducible Nitric OXide Synthase ( NOS I + II ) , Which in turn reduces the ( neur0na1 ) f0rmati0n 0f nitric 0Xide and thereby the f0rmati0n 0f per0Xynitrite Which may attack the brain ce1ls 0r their membranes. In d0ing sO , 2 - imin0bi0tin surprisingly d0es n0t sh0W the adVerse effect 0f ( als0 ) inhibiting the end0thelial f0rm 0f nitric 0Xide synthase ( eNOS ) ; 0r at 1east is m0re speciﬁc in inhibiting nNOS and iNOS re1atiVe t0 eNOS , thereby 1eaVing the cerebra1 perfusi0n intact. Furtherm0re , alth0ugh the inVenti0n has been described ab0Ve With reference t0 2 - imin0bi0tin ( the preferred c0m - p0und 0f the inVenti0n ) , it is enVisaged that any 0ther aVailab1e speciﬁc neur0na1 nitric 0Xide synthase inhibit0r e. g. might giVe c0mparable resu1ts. S0me n0n - limiting eXamples 0f such suitable selectiVe nitric 0Xide synthase inhibit0rs may include S - benzyl - is0thi0urea ( such as the hydr0chl0ride there0f ) , a - guanidin0g1utaric acid ( GGA ) ; L - thi0citru11ine , L - N5 - ( 1 - imin0ethy1 ) 0rnithine ( L - NIO ) ( such as the hydr0chl0ride there0f ) ; NG - m0n0methyl - L - arginine ( NMEA ) ; TRIM 0r pharmaceutically and / 0r Veterinary acceptable salts there0f. The inVenti0n Wi1l n0W be illustrated by means 0f the f0110Wing Figures and eXamp1es , Which d0 n0t iimit the sc0pe 0f the inVenti0n. In the Figures : .

During hyp0Xia FiO2 Was reduced >0n - 1ine=unti1 PCr / Pi had decreased t0 at least 25% 0f baseline Values. Immediately after HI the piglets receiVed either placeb0 ( PLAC ; n=10 ) , ALLO ( 20 mg / kg iV ; n=10 ) , DFO ( 10 mg / kg iV ; n=10 ) 0r 2 - IB ( 150 MM i. V. ; n=7 ) . Bef0re HI and fr0m 3 t0 24 h p0st HI the piglets Were m0nit0red using aEEG f0r e1ectrica1 brain actiVity determinati0n. A neur0l0gic sc0ring system Was used ranging fr0m 4 ( n0rmal ) t0 0 ( ﬁat trace ) . F0r 1H - MRS a PRESS sequence With CHESS Water suppressi0n Was used t0 deﬁne a 1.7 ml periVentricular VOXel ( TR 6 s , TE 144 ms , and nt=32 0r 64 ) . 31P - MRS Was d0ne using a 4 cm - diameter surface c0il f0r eXcitati0n and detecti0n ( TR 10 s , nt=32 ) . Peak amplitudes 0f PCr , Pi , Lac and NAA Were determined With time d0main ﬁtting pr0cedures ( VARPRO ) . Paired t - tests Were used t0 c0mpare measurements at 24 h Versus base1ine ; repeated ANOVA serVed t0 m0nit0r f0r trends betWeen treatment gr0ups. Results. Three pig1ets in the PLAC gr0up and 1pig1et in the ALLO gr0up died due t0 HI c0mp1icati0ns at respectiVely 5 , 9 and 19 h and 18 h p0st HI , 1 pig1et died at 13 h in the DFO gr0up because 0f hyp0V0lemic sh0ck and 1 in the 2 - IB gr0up due t0 sepsis. 31P - MR spectra 0f a representatiVe PLAC and 2 - IB - treated pig1et are sh0Wn in FIG. 1 at 24 h p0st HI. Sec0ndary energy fai1ure , deﬁned as a sec0ndary fa11 in PCr / Pi is 0bserVed in the PLAC , but n0t in the 2 - IB piglet. PCr / Pi as percentage 0f baseline and Lac / NAA rati0s fr0m n0rm0Xia t0 24 h p0st HI f0r al1 treatment gr0ups presented in FIG. 2. F0r the 2 - IB gr0up 24 h p0st HI Values Were identica1 t0 baseline Va1ues 0f PCr / Pi and Lac / NAA. F0r. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 8. Hist0l0gical analysis at 24 h p0st the hyp0Xia - ischemic peri0d reVealed m0re aliVe cells in the 2 - IB treated piglets in the brain regi0ns at risk after HI ( hipp0campus , c0rteX , striatum and cerebe11um ) , 1ess necr0sis and a better preserVed structural architecture. Furtherm0re , immun0his - t0chemistry f0r nitr0tyr0sylati0n in the affected areas ( a pr0duct being f0rmed by the interacti0n 0f per0Xynitrite 0n tyr0sine residues ) sh0Wed n0 staining in the 2 - IB treated piglets , Whereas the placeb0 treated pig1ets had a c0nsiderably 1eVel 0f nitr0tyr0sylati0n. This suggests that 2 - IB can pass the bl00d brain barrier after hyp0Xia - ischemia and that it actually reduces the am0unt 0f per0Xynitrite that is being f0rmed in brain cells. C0nc1usi0n. Whereas ALLO en DFO preVented partly the reducti0n in PCr / Pi rati0s at 24 h p0st HI , 2 - IB preserVed c0mpletely cerebral energy stats at 24 h p0st HI. 2 - IB and t0 a lesser degree ALLO and DFO preVented increment 0f Lac / NAA at 24 h p0st HI and preserVed electrical brain actiVity. Hist0l - 0gy c0nﬁrmed this 0utc0me including less nitr0tyr0sy1ati0n staining in the 2 - IB treated animals. We speculate that the remarkable preserVati0n 0f the cerebral energy status by 2 - IB is due t0 preVenti0n 0f the f0rmati0n 0f per0Xynitrite f0ll0Wing hyp0Xia - ischemia in the neWb0rn piglet.
