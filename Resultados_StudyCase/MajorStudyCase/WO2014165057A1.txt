WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Cross - Reference to Related Applications. This app1ication claims priority to USSN 61 / 777 , 484 , ﬁled March 12 , 2013. The contents of that application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Background. Certain plants , such as members of the Sapindaceae fami1y and edible p1ants 11ke sorghum and lima beans contain cyanogenic secondary metabo1ites. P1ants store their cyanogenic secondary metabo1ites in compartments separated from catabo1ic or hydro1yzing enzymes. The breakdown of the cyanogenic secondary metabolites and subsequent cyanide ( CN - ) 1iberation does not occur until damage to the plant causes mixing of the enzyme and substrate components. Cyan0genic secondary metabo1ites are. stab1e in the absence of a catabo1ic enzyme. Summary The invention is based in part on the discovery that cyanogenic glycosides and their chemically active groups— - cyanohydrins — are safe and effective against infectious disease when administered to animals , inc1uding humans. A large amount of stabilized cyanogenic compound can be ingested by or injected into an anima1 or human body Without toxic side effects , a1though compositions according to the inVention work at 10w dosage. The compositions and methods provide a broad spectrum medication that has an enorm0us advantage in hea1th care and epidemio1ogy of humans and animals , including areas of the wor1d where speciﬁc diagnostic testing is not readi1y availab1e. Efforts to eradicate infectious diseases can beneﬁt immensely from rapid1y eliminating the infective virus from the patients , thereby reducing spreading the virus. The compositions and methods disc1osed herein can a1so be used to prevent the spreading of diseases to. susceptible peop1e or anima1s. lO. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. Suitable compositions useful in the invention include cyanogenic glycosides and / or their synthetic versions and derivatives , cyanohydrins and their sa1ts and their conjugates and derivatives and other groups , and cyan01ipids ( Types I - IV ) and their derivatives. The compositions are effective against virus , bacteria , fungus , parasites and protozoa. Accordingly , the compostions are capable of preventing and curing viral , bacterial , funga1 , parasitic and pr0tozoa induced disease. They are additiona11y usefu1 for treating inﬂammation , inc1uding inﬂammation associated with disease. Inﬂammation can be acute or chronic.

Unless otherwise deﬁned , a11 technica1 and scientiﬁc terms used herein have the same meaning as common1y understood by one of ordinary ski1l in the art to which this invention belongs.

Other features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the fo11owing. description , and from the claims. mm. It has been discovered that there is a biochemical based “immune system” or protective mechanism that exists in the anima1 and human body and which forms a ﬁrst line of defense against microbes and parasites. This biochemical protection is created naturally by consumption of certain food and hand1es the majority of viral , bacteria and parasitic infections , in some cases Without fu1l activation of the innate immune system and activation of the adaptive immune system. Therefore , very little sign of disease would appear , such as , in inﬂuenza infection , fever or sweating , since there is no cytokine activation. The biochemica1 shie1d si1ently e1iminates the virus without a1erting deeper 1ayers of immunity. It has a1so been discovered that this biochemica1 shie1d can be dep1eted and rendered non functional. This wou1d otherwise put an extra strain on the bio1ogica1 immune system such that the individual would soon become exhausted , and therefore , vulnerab1e to frequent infections. App1ication of the compositions of the. invention to a human or animal body can restore this natura1 protective shie1d before or. _11_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. after a microbia1 infection occurs and bring about a prevention or cure of an actual infection. The biochemica1 shie1d is formed by administering to a subject puriﬁed p1ant extracts and / or pharmaceuticaﬂy acceptable salt thereof , plant extract derivatives , plant extract conjugates and / or their synthetic analogs and all of their stereo isomers , chira1s , epimers , enantiomers and / 0r other natura1 enzyme substrates. Administration can be. intravenously , intramuscular1y , subcutaneous1y , intraperitonialy , intrapleuraly , intrabrochialy , intrauterine , ora11y , topically , into joints , into the urinary system , into bone and into teeth , into gingival pocket , into ear , into eye , into conjunctiva , into nose and sinuses , sub1ingual1y , intratheca1ly , intra - arthicular1y , per rectal1y , into cerebrospina1 ﬂuid , applying as wound dressing , by inhalation by spray or humidiﬁed air or by any other suitable administration route . The composition is formu1ated in the form of a pil1 , capsu1e , granu1e , tab1et , pal1et , suspension , injection , infusion , suppository , continuous delivery system , syrup , tincture , ointment , cream , eye drops , eardrops , ﬂush , 1avage , s1ow absorbing depot , dressing , lozenge or any pharmaceutica11y acceptab1e app1ication or as a nutritiona1 supp1ement. The cyanogenic compositions of the invention are preferably provided in a puriﬁed form , i. e. , separated from mo1ecu1es with which they are naturally associated. Puriﬁed and / or isolated cyanogenic compositions are particularly useful in the methods and compositions described herein. By ”puriﬁed” or ”substantially puriﬁed” is meant a cyanogenic composition that is substantial1y free of contaminating molecu1es microorganisms or other macromo1ecules , e. g. , one or more of polysaccharides , nuc1eic acids , proteins or essentia1 oi1s , saponins , ﬂavan0ids , ephedrins , ethano1 , triterpenes , tanning agents , phytosterols , alka1oids that inhibit the activity and / or stability of the cyanogenic composition. A puriﬁed preparation contains at 1east 75% , 85% , 95% , 97% , 99% , or 100% of the desired composition and is substantia11y free of other sub - ce11u1ar components such as cytop1asmic organel1es. For examp1e , cyanogenic compositions can be provided substantia11y free of hydrolytic enzymes such as emulsine , amygda1in1yase , prunasine 1yase , hydroxynitri1e. 1yase , alpha and beta glycosidase , and mann0sidase. _12_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. In some embodiments , the cyanogenic compositions are provided without compositions that adversely affect their effectiveness. In some embodiments the cyanogenic compositions are a1so provided substantia11y free of iron - containing organic molecu1es and / or vitamins. If the cyanogenic compositions are not separated from other constituents of the extract there can be instabi1ity , undesirable and unpredictab1e interactions between the cyanogenic g1ycoside and other constituents. For examp1e , methy1cobolamin and other ana1ogs in sma1l doses can inhibit amygdalins effectiveness against viruses. Lactoferrin and / or artemisinin are also preferably absent because they can inhibit the effectiveness of cyanogenic glycosides in treating a virus infection. For the same reasons the cyanogenic compositions are preferab1y provided or used in the absence of organic fruits and / or vegetable juice , which can inhibit the effectiveness of the cyanogenic compositions. With a puriﬁed cyanogenic composition it is possib1e to dose the medicine properly because the quantities of the cyanogenic composition in the composition are known. Before the instant invention , the effective amount of a cyanogenic composition in a p1ant extract was difﬁcu1t or impossib1e to determine because additiona1 constituents. in the extract could inhibit the effectiveness of the cyanogenic composition. Cvanogenic Compositions. Cyanogenic compositions of the invention can be prepared using modiﬁcations of methods known in the art. The source material for the extraction can be , e. g. , any suitable plant and / or seed stock known to or suspected to have a cyanogenic composition. For examp1e , suitab1e sources include , e. g. , Vetch seed subspecies such as Vicia angustifo1ia , Vicia sativa cordata or nigra , germinated sorghum seed , bitter a1mond , seeds from a stone fruit such as Peach ( Prunus persica ) — Kernel , Plum ( Prunus spp. ) —— Kernel , Cherry ( Prunus spp. ) , Apricot ( Prunus armeniace ) — Kerne1 , Nectarine ( Prunus persica var nucipersica ) —Kernel. Typically , a ﬁrst step in the process is deactiVation of the hydro1yzing enzymes. This can be accomp1ished using one of severa1 methods , e. g , dipping the fresh plant material into boiling a1coho1 , boi1ing the fresh p1ant material with acetone , or freeze - . _13_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. drying the plant material before extraction and , when the enzyme is deactivated , mi11ing the plant material. A second step is to remove oi1 if present with petro1eum ether or another non polar so1vent. A third step is a further extraction. A different extraction solvent can be used if desired. Suitab1e so1vents for the third step include , e. g. , water with citric acid , hot 50 - 99 % methano1 , a hot water - —ethanol mix , or hot 99% ethano1 , with reﬂuxing for l - 6 hours , with or without sonication. The optima1 extraction pH is in the range of 6.5 - 7.5. The fourth step is the ﬁ1tration and concentration of the extract by the evaporation of the solvent under vacuum or reverse osm0sis. The ﬁfth step is the puriﬁcation step using crysta1lization , HPLC , and / or slow rotary counter - current chromatography ( SRCCC ) or a mixture of these methods. The end product is a 95—99 % pure cyanogenic glycoside composition. This composition can be used as it is or mixed with different excipients. In some embodiments , the puriﬁed composition is incubated with sodium or potassium thiosufate ( e. g. , a 3 : 1 to 6 : l ratio of cyanogenic glycoside / sodium thiosufate ) to form a supramo1ecular complex cal1ed tecton. This renders the cyanogenic composition safe and non toxic for medicina1 use. A nomenc1ature to refer to the cyanogenic compositions of the invention when present in a comp1ex with sodium thiosu1fate is a BIOTECTON “4 shield or BIOPHYTOTECTONTM shie1d / tectum= shie1d or protect in Latin for the designation of such protective molecu1es / and named the mechanism a biochemica1 protection. The product is very stab1e and can be stored at room temperature for more than two years without degradation and 10ss of effectiveness. It is also very safe to use since it contains no free cyanide. For this reason , high therapeutic doses ( e. g. , 2— 15 mg / kg ) can be safe1y administered to a patient. While not wishing to be b0und by theory , it is postulated that the cyanogenic g1ycoside composition is ineffective against bacteria or virus when it is tested in vitro ( e. g. , in a Petri dish ) because the hydrolyzing enzyme of the plant , which is required for cyanide liberation , has been deactivated. However , the inventive medicine is very effective and safe in vivo because speciﬁc activation 0f the inventive medicine occurs. with the patients immune cells on1y at the site of the infection. This exp1ains the rapid. - 14_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 3O. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. cure rate and the very 10w toxicity , a1ong with its wide spectrum of activity against pathogens. Moreover , it is not the pathogen or the p1ants endogenous enzymes but rather the patients inﬂammatory ce11s that activate the mo1ecules. A cyanogenic composition of the invention can alternative1y include commercially avai1ab1e amygda1in , although commercia11y availab1e amygdalin is not a homogenous material but is instead is a mixture of different isomers.

The proportion of the different isomers in a cyanogenic composition can vary depending on the type of p1ant material that has been used to extract the cyanogenic glycoside mixture. With the exception of prunasine they a11 have the same mo1ecular weight but are different stereoisomers. A preferred cyanogenic g1ycoside is a B1OTECTONTM g1ycoside , which is formed by mixing a cyan0genic g1ycoside with a sulﬁte , e. g. , sodium thiosu1fate. When these tw0 molecules incubated together they form tectons ( self assembled molecular complexes ) , and this complex protects the cyanogenic g1ycoside from enzymatic breakdown. Therefore , this complex can be used at higher concentrations without oral and injectab1e toxicity relative to the usab1e concentration of a cyanogenic glycoside a1one. Whi1e not wishing to be bound by theory , it is postu1ated that the mechanism invo1ved is not only the detoxiﬁcation of the cyanide by the rhodanase enzyme using the thiosu1fate as the other substrate but also the comp1exs stability and resistance to re1easing cyanide. A puriﬁed cyanogenic composition of the invention can be applied in an injectable form when ora1 administration is not indicated. For example , for some diseases oral app1ication not possib1e , e. g. , in the case of a subject with vomiting or diarrhea common with viral disease , and which make the abs0rption of the medicine unpredictable. Puriﬁed cyanogenic compositions are a1so very stab1e because no enzyme is present from the p1ant that can degrade the cyanogenic composition. With puriﬁed cyanogenic compositions there is no interaction or nulliﬁcation of effectiveness , since. only the cyanogenic compositions are present. Treatment of chronic infection and inﬂammation. The cyanogenic 00mp0sitions can be used to treat chronic infections and ( inc1uding chronic , hidden infection ) and associated inﬂammation in different organs of the body. It has been discovered that certain chronic hidden infections in the body do not. induce white b100d cell elevation or do not induce a sufﬁciently strong immune response. - 16—. 10. 15. 2O. 25. 3O. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014l024262. in the mamma1s body to clear an infection. These hidden infections can continue in the diSeased organ for a 10ng time with some mild and 0ften unnoticed 10cal inﬂammation until the diseased organ starts to fail and the patient develops more clinica1 symptoms. A this point a patient may visit a doctor and the patient is diagnosed. Unfortunately , by this time the condition is advanced and the treatment insufﬁcient. Thus , these “hidden infections” are associated with the patients immune systems fai1ure to recognize the infectious organism and clear the infection. Typical of these chronic diseases are chronic prostatitis , chronic cholangiohepatitis , chronic cystitis , chronic pancreatitis , chronic bronchitis or bronchopneumonia , chronic enteritis , and chronic glomerulonephritis. These diseases are progressive in nature , likely to recur , and often show a poor response to therapy. It has been discovered that when cyanogenic compositions are applied to patients with these chronic diseases , and a blood test is retaken 2—4 days fo11owing initiation of treatment , the previously normal white blood cell count suddenly is signiﬁcantly elevated. This event is associated with clinical improvement and fast resolution of the disease. Although the mechanism not ful1y understood it seems that the association of the cyanogenic composition with infection improves the immune systems abi1ity to recognize speciﬁc antigens and respond with a defense sufﬁciently strong to overcome the infection. The examples below show successful treatment 0f chronic prostatitis , chronic bronchitis or bronchopneumonia , in a d0g or human using a cyanogenic composition.

WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. active ingredient , as above deﬁned , together with one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier ( s ) should be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and physio1ogically innocuous to the recipient thereof. The formu1ations inc1ude those suitab1e for the foregoing administration routes. The formu1ations may conVenienﬂy be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods we11 known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formu1ations genera11y are found in Remington ' s Pharmaceutical Sciences , Mack Publishing Company , Easton , PA , ( l985 ) . Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. ln general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers , ﬁne1y divided solid carriers , or both , and then , if necessary , shaping the product. Formu1ations of the present1y disc1osed subject matter suitab1e for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules , cachets , or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient ; as a powder or granules ; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non - aqueous 1iquid ; or as an oi1 - in - water 1iquid emulsion or a water—in - oi1 1iquid emu1sion. The active ingredient may a1so be administered as a bo1us , electuary , or paste. A tab1et is made by compression or molding , optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tab1ets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free - ﬂowing form such as a powder or granules , optiona1ly mixed with a binder , lubricant , inert di1uent , preservative , surface active or dispersing agent. Mo1ded tablets may be made by molding in a suitab1e machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tab1ets may optiona1ly be coated or scored and optiona1ly are f0rmulated so as to provide slow or contro11ed re1ease of the active ingredient therefrom.

When formulated. _23_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. in an ointment , the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffmic or a water - miscib1e ointment base. A1ternative1y , the active ingredients may be formu1ated in a cream with an oil - in - water cream base. If desired , the aqueous phase of the cream base may include , for examp1e , at least 30% w / w of a po1yhydric alcoho1 , i. e. , an alcoho1 having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propy1ene glycol , butane 1 , 3 - dio1 , mannito1 , sorbito1 , glycero1 and polyethylene g1yco1 ( inc1uding PEG 400 ) and mixtures thereof. The topica1 formulations may desirab1y inc1ude a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examp1es of such derma1 penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs. The oily phase of the emu1sions of this disclosed subject matter may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. Whi1e the phase may inc1ude merely an emulsiﬁer ( otherwise known as an emu1gent ) , it desirab1y inc1udes a mixture of at 1east one emulsiﬁer with a fat or an oi1 or with both a fat and an oil. Preferab1y , a hydrophilic emulsiﬁer is included together with a lipophilic emu1siﬁer which acts as a stabi1izer. It is a1so preferred to inc1ude both an oil and a fat. Together , the emulsif [ iota ] er ( s ) with or without stabi1izer ( s ) make up the so - ca11ed emulsifying wax , and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so - called emulsifying ointment base that forms the oi1y dispersed phase of the cream formu1ations. Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitab1e for use in the formulation of the cyanogenic compounds , as disclosed herein , include TWEEN 60 , SPAN 80 , cetosteary1 a1cohol , benzy1 a1coho1 , myristy1 a1cohol , glycery1 mono—stearate andsodium lauryl su1fate. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formu1ation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties. The cream should preferab1y be a non—greasy , non - staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid 1eakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain , mono - or dibasic a1ky1 esters such as diisoadipate , isocety1 stearate , propy1ene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids , isopropyl myristate , decyl oleate , isopropy1 pa1mitate , butyl stearate , 2 - ethylhexyl pa1mitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used , the 1ast three being. preferred esters.

In addition to the ingredients particu1ar1y mentioned above the formu1ations of the cyanogenic compounds , as disclosed herein , may include other agents conventiona1 in the art having regard to the type of formu1ation in question , for examp1e those suitable for ora1 administration may include ﬂavoring agents. The cyanogenic compounds , as disclosed herein , can also be formu1ated to provide contro1led re1ease of the active ingredient to a1low less frequent dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity proﬁle of the active ingredient. Accordingly , the cyanogenic compounds , as disclosed herein , a1so provided compositions inc1uding one or more cyanogenic compounds formu1ated for sustained or contro11ed release. An effective dose of active ingredient depends at 1east on the nature of the condition being treated , toxicity , whether the compound is being used prophylactical1y ( typica1ly 10wer doses ) , the method of delivery , and the pharmaceutica1 formu1ation , and is determined by the clinician using conventiona1 dose esca1ation studies.

All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims made herein. The invention will be further i1lustrated in the fo1lowing non - 1imiting examp1es. Example 1. Preparation and testing of a BIOTECTON TM cvanogenic composition. A BIOTECTONTM glycoside contains 400 - 500 mg mandelonitrile glycosides and. about 100 mg sodium thiosulﬁte in water so1ution. These are incubated in a water bath 30—50° C for 1 - 3 hours. During this time color changes occur with some recrystalization. and dissolution , but after several hours the no additional color change occurs. When this process occurs at room temperature it takes about 24 hours to complete the complex formation. This complex has no toxic effect at a dose of 5000 mg / body weight kg by oral application while the literature has LD50 for amygdalin about 900 mg / body weight kg. The BIOTECTONTM glycoside has about 20 - 3 0% longer effectiveness than previously described amygdalin isomers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of a BIOTECTONTM glycoside composition , a double - blind paSteurella infection test was performed on rabbits in the Pharmacology and. Toxicology Department of the Veterinary University of Hungary. In the infected contro1. - 33 - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. group , 100% of the rabbits died while all ( 100% ) of the rabbits treated with the BIOTECTONTM glycoside composition survived. Moreover , pasteurella could not be. cu1tured out of the live rabbits. Example 2. Treatment of canine parvovirus infections using a cvanogenic composition. Canine parvovirus gastro enteritis on young unvaccinated dogs typically exhibits a mortality rate of approximately 85%. Dogs that survive recover within seven days. With aggressive support therapy the mortality rate drops to about 20 - 40% , depending upon the virulence of the strain. 35 dogs aged 2 - 4 months of mixed gender and breed and suffering from canine parvoviral infections and testing positive with the SNAP Parvo Elisa Test were subcutaneously injected once with a lactated ringer solution calculated on about a 6 weight percent ( wt % ) dehydration rate. The dogs were injected subcutaneously twice a day for ﬁve days with about a 10 mg / kg dose of the aqueous solution of cyanogenic composition sodium amygdale prepared as described herein. Typical1y , vomiting and diarrhea had subsided signiﬁcantly on all dogs within 24 hours of the beginning of the treatment. After 48 hours , only two dogs had weak diarrhea. After 72 hours , all dogs were diarrhea free. No adverse effects were observed during or after this treatment regime. A11 of the dogs completely recovered with the ﬁve day treatment regime. E1even of the thirty ﬁve dogs were in extreme duress at the beginning of the treatment and probably would have died without the treatment. The ﬁnal analysiS of the data reveals about a 60 - 80% faster recovery time , the complete elimination of any. mortality , and a 60—95% reduction of symptoms after the ﬁrst injection. Example 3. Treatment of human cold and ﬂu infections using a cyanogenic composition A S3—year 82 kg man typically exhibited the following symptoms during the course of a ﬂu infection : ( 1 ) inﬂammation of the nasopharyngea1 membrane on Day 1 ; . ( 2 ) inﬂammation of the throat mucosa membrane and a cough , sore throat , runny nose , as. _39 - . lO. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. well as nasal congestion on Day 2 ; and ( 3 ) severe tracheitis. When left untreated , general symptoms genera1ly included , for examp1e , fatigue , loss of appetite , muscle ache , joint ache , and sweating that appeared on Day l , increased through Day 3 , and persisted for 8 - 14 days. During his next infection , the same 53 - year 82 kg man exhibited : ( 1 ) inﬂammation of the nasopharyngeal membrane on Day 1 ; ( 2 ) inﬂammation of the throat mucosa membrane and a cough , sore throat , runny nose , nasal congestion on Day 2 ; and ( 3 ) severe tracheitis. Treatment was begun on Day 1 by orally administering a total dose of about 200 mg of a cyanogenic composition prepared as described herein twice per day ( about 5 mg / kg bodyweight per day ) for the ﬁrst two days , then a dose of about 100 mg of amygdalin twice per day ( about 2.5 mg / kg bodyweight per day ) for the next two days. After the ﬁrst day , all ﬂu symptoms disappeared. Example 4. Treatment of feline rhinotracheitis using a cvanogenic composition. Seventeen cats ages two months to three years suffering from feline rhinotracheitis with symptoms of fever , 10ss of appetite , coughing , sneezing , nasal discharge , conjuntivitis , and pneumonia were divided into Groups A and Group B. The Group A cats ( 8 cats total ) were given the oral antibiotic clavomox at a dosage of about 10 mg / kg of bodyweight 5 twice a day. These cats did not improve until after 6 or 7 days. Three cats continued to show symptoms of nasal discharge for up to two weeks. The Group B cats ( 9 cats total ) were subcutaneously injected with about a 10 mg / kg dose of the aqueous solution of a cyanogenic composition prepared as described herein at a dosage of about 10 mg / kg bodyweight once per day for three days. After three. days , al1 clinical symptoms had disappeared. Example 5. Preliminarv toxicology studies of a cvanogenic composition A preliminary toxicology study was conducted on ﬁve white mice. An acute toxicology dose of a cyanogenic compound prepared as described herein was applied up. to 5000mg / body Kg / day . Separate oral and injection trials were conducted. No toxicity. - 40 - . 10. lS. 2O. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. event was detected after ﬁve consecutiVe days of application. All ﬁve mice survived at 1east one month after termination of the study. The in - vitro test also showed that even in high concentration a cyanogenic composition was not toxic to the cells in cell culture. While not wishing to be bound by theory , it is postu1ated that the low toxicity of the cyanogenic composition is the result of a unique mo1ecular comp1ex formation. This complex is responsible for the resistance of the molecule against hydro1ysis , even in the presence of a hydroxynitrile lyase. The mo1ecu1ar complex forms on the acetonitrile moiety of the cyanogenic g1ycosides in the presence of the sodium thiosulfate and water during incubation. In a water solution the acetonitrile portion accepts a proton and becomes positively charged. The thiosulfate ion is negatively charged and at the double bond on the sulfur side the ion is hydrophobic , and therefore no water shell covering can occur. The thiosulfate ion ooordinates with the protonated positively charged acetonitrile. This complex formation interferes with the lyase enzyme activity on the molecule and blocks hydrogen cyanide formation , hence the very low toxicity. The protonation on the acetonitrile side of the water solution is made possible by the higher proton afﬁnity of acetonitrile compared to water. H2O proton afﬁnity 166.5. ( kca1 mol - 1 ) , CH3 CN proton afﬁnity 188.0 kca1 mol—1 ) . A further in viv0 acute toxicity study was performed in 18 mice using oral or intraperitonea1 administration. The study was conducted in three dose groups — three mice in each — for both oral and intraperitoneal administration , respectively. For animal welfare reasons a starting dose of 300 mg / kg body weight ( cf OECD 423 , Annex 2 c : Starting dose is : 300 mg / kg bw. ) was chosen. Anima1s received 300 , 2000 and 5000 mg test substance BIOTECTON®” cyanogenic composition for one kilogram of bodyweight in a single oral or intraperitoneal dose. Gross pathology and histopathology tests were performed two weeks post - treatment. The BIOTECTON® cyanogenic test composition was a clear , transparent , and sterile solution. Purity data and description of physico - chemical properties were not available. The test substance vehicle was a sterile physio1ogical ( 0.9% w / v ) saline solution. This. vehicle is an isotonic and isosmotic solvent frequent1y app1ied in injection 1iquids as a. carrier ( cf. USP , PhEUR ) . - 41_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014I024262. White laboratory mice of the BDF1—strain were used in the study. The test animals were bred and kept using routine procedures , according to their microbiological status. In this test 18 adult , male mice were used. Their age was between lO and 12. weeks at the start of the trial. The test animals were obtained from the National Institute of Oncology ( Hungary , Budapest ) . The mice were kept in standard rodent boxes ( 40x12.5xl2 cm ) , three animals per allocation. The room temperature was between 21 - 23 0C. The relative air humidity was between 50 - 65% RH during the study. The feeding was managed from trough feeders , with watering from bottles. An artiﬁcial light program was applied with 12 hour 1ight and 12 hour dark periods. The animals were randomly selected , marked to permit individual identiﬁcation , and kept in their cages for seven days prior to dosing to al1ow for acclimatization to 1aboratory conditions. In this trial a steri1e watery so1ution of a BIOTECTON® cyanogenic composition was administered to 1aboratory mice. The animals received a sing1e oral or intraperitoneal dose of the test substance , respective1y. The application was performed based on the instructions of the OECD 423 guideline. Treatments were performed with either the di1uted ( with physiological , sterile saline ) or non - di1uted ( 100 and 200 mg / ml ) formulation of BIOTECTON® cyanogenic compositions. The test substance in the PO group was administered in a single dose by gavage using a stomach tube , and administered to the IP group in a single dose using sterile disposable plastic syringe and need1e ( G25 ) . Three animals per route of app1ication were used for each step. First , mice were treated two times three ( per oral and intraperitoneal ) animals received 300 mg / kg bw. of the test BIOTECTON® substance. No mice died. The test was then continued with the administration of 2000 mg / kg in next 3 p1us 3 animals , respectively. Because of the absence of letha1 effect in 2000 mg / kg groups , another 3 plus 3 mice were treated orally or intraperitoneally with 5000 mg / kg dose after another four hours observation. The test mice received standard rodent feed and water in drinking quality ad. libitum during the whole trial. The animals were fasted on the day of the administration. _42_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. of the test substance. Feeding was withhe1d for 4 hours prior the app1ication. Mice received their next feeding two hours after the receiving the drug. Animals were observed individually after dosing once during the ﬁrst 30 minutes and then periodically during the ﬁrst 24 hours , with specia1 attention given during the ﬁrst 4 hours , and dain thereafter , for a tota1 of 14 days. The fol1owing table ( Table 2 ) shows the resu1ts of clinical observation. Observations inc1uded changes in skin and fur , eyes and mucous membranes , and also respiratory , circulatory , autonomic and centra1 nervous systems , and somatomotor activity and behaviour pattern. No evidence of any clinica1 sign of toxic reaction was detected in 10w or in high doses the PO or IP treated groups of mice. Individual weights of anima1s at the day of dosing , in week1y intervals thereafter , and at time of death or sacriﬁce were recorded. Prior to the scheduled sacriﬁce not a single animal died. In the time course of post treatment period no sign of toxic reaction was observed. Each animal remained healthy and survived the tw0 weeks of the post - treatment observation period. Al1 test animals participated in the trial survived , and at the end of a two week observation period they were subjected to gross necropsy. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Gross pathology examination and the weights of the liver , spleen , and right kidney were recorded individually. Liver , sp1een , kidney , lung , heart , and smal1 intestine tissue samp1es were subjected to histopatho1ogica1 examination. In 11 mice of 18 fatty inﬁltration of the liver was detected , presumably reﬂecting good body condition. The minor alterations in internal organs detected with histopatho1ogy are vital reactions , and cannot be considered as the consequence of supposed toxic effect of test substance. In six animals ( No 1 , 4 , 7 , 12 , 16 , 18 ) the liver was hyperaemic , and the lung tissue was hyperaemic only in animal No 7. In sp1een tissue , lymphoid depletion was observed in animals 6 and 7. In the same tissue the signs of megacymsz ' s were detected in one PO and three IP treated animals. However , these alterations do not appear to be in strong positive corre1ation with the applied dose. In animal No 5 slight segmental tubular nephrosis was seen ( possibly due to another harming effect ) . Fusion of the intestina1 villi occurred in 8 animals of 18 , but. possibly not as the result of the administration of test substance. _43_. 10. 15. 2O. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. Acute oral t0xicity refers to th0se adverse effects occurring fol1owing oral administration of a sing1e dose of a substance , or multiple doses given within 24 hours. De1ayed death means that an anima1 does not die or appear moribund within 48 hours but dies later during the l4—day observation period ( OECD 423 ) . The mice showed neither weight 10ss , other adverse effects nor de1ayed death fo1lowing administration of the BIOTECTON® cyanogenic composition. Although histopathology examination revealed light signs of splenotoxicity ( i. e. megacytosis ) and some other minor alteration of internal organs were observed in several treated animals , the absence of clinical signs and lethality shows the BIOTECTON® cyanogenic composition can be considered as a practica1ly non toxic agent according to both per 05 ( PO ) and intraperitoneal ( IP ) application. After the single application of 5000 mg / kg BIOTECTON® , as the upper limitation on testing ( OECD 423 ) , neither clinical sign of toxicity nor letha1 effect could be detected. BIOTECTON® can thus be considered as a. practically harmless substance , regarding to the Globally Harmonised Classiﬁcation. System for Chemical Substances ( GHS ) . Example 6. In vitro efﬁcacv of a cvanogenic composition against canine parvovirus 2 mm. Without wishing to be bound by theory , it is postulated that the compositions of the invention are pro - drugs and as such become activated after entering a patients body. The activation takes place at the site of the infection in the tissue or b1ood by the innate immune system where ever inﬂammation occurs in the patient. These types of medicines cannot be tested with the traditional1y conducted in - vitro test for efﬁcacy eva1uations. Instead , the composition was tested and compared in a canine parvovirus cell culture. system and in live dogs. Method and materials : The virus was cultured in 25 cm2 ﬂask . Each ﬂask contained 250000 MDCK ce1ls and was infected with 109 TCID50 type two dog parvovirus ( canine parvovirus 2 , . CPV2 ) in the University of Veterinary Science Hungary department of Viro1ogy.

The cycle threshold is that point where the double strand DNA production during PCR ﬁrst can be measured. A 10wer level of cycle threshold is indicative of a higher amount of DNA in the sample , which indicates virus production. The test resu1ts show that up to 20mg / m1 Biotecton concentration in the growth media did not reduce cycle threshold , indicating no in~vitro b1ocking of virus propagation. Very high concentration of Biotecton increased virus production . These data show that the inventive cyanogenic composition did not cause inhibition of Parvovirus reproduction in cell culture , in contrast to reports of other p1ant extracts. claiming to be effective against viruses. Example 7. In vivo efﬁcacv of a cvanogenic composition against canine parvovirus 2. ( CPV2 ) . The cyanogenic composition was next tested on 60 parvovirus - infected dogs The test was conducted in an animal shelter in Hungary. Two random1y groups were selected. One group ( 20 dogs ) received the inactivated medicine and the other group ( 40 dogs ) received an active cyanogenic composition. The placebo treatment was conducted with heat inactivated medicine on 20 parvovirus positive dogs with concurrent lactated ringer. ﬂuid therapy ( the standard treatment ) in which group the mortality rate was 80% ( 16 _ 47 _. lO. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. dogs died and 4 survived ) . Those that survived had a recovery time that averaged nine days. The other group of 40 young d0g / parvo - antigen tested positive / received the cyanogenic composition and the lactated ringer treatment. The treating veterinarian was unaware which medicine was active and which was inactive. The reported morta1ity rate was 10% and comp1ete recovery rate 90% ( 4 dogs died and 36 dogs survived / ) . The average recovery time was 4 days. All 60 dog was treated in the same shelter and a11 dogs contracted the disease naturally. All 60 dogs had exact1y the same treatment / except the cyanogenic composition vs. p1acebo / . The environment and severity of the disease a1so was about the same except for the four dogs that died and received the active medicine . Those four dogs came to the shelter with advanced dehydration and died short1y after arriva1. This indicates that the efﬁcacy rate was higher than 90% if the irresolvab1e metabolic break down would be excluded from the evaluation. The conclusion of the doub1e~blind study and the in - vitro test on dog parvovirus indicate that the cyanogenic composition is high1y effective in - vivo and harm1ess to the virus and to the culture cells in vitro because an activation step in the patients body is necessary for the medicine to become effective. This a1so accounts for the extremely low toxicity of the cyanogenic composition. The results thus provide a further advantage compared to known antiviral medications , which can show signiﬁcant side effects and. are genera1ly toxic even in much lower concentrations. Example 8. Control1ed studv of the effectiveness of a cvanogenic composition in treating fe1ine respiratorv svndrome. In an animal shelter a FVR and F CV combination outbreak can seriously threaten the cat popu1ation. The effectiveness of a cyanogenic composition was examined in treating a fe1ine respiratory viral infection / DNA and RNA virus infection / with Feline viral rhinotracheitis / FVR / feline hepesvirus 11 and Fe1ine calicivirus / FCV / in 117 cats was examined in a / contro1led study / .

The sick cats were clinically further diagnosed with ulcerated stomatitis or absence of ulcerated stomatitis for the c1inica1 determination of the presence of Feline calicivirus. The ulcerated stomatitis appeared most1y on the tip of the tongue and the gum line. The number of cats representing this group with upper respiratory symptoms plus u1cerative stomatitis was 48 cats out of 117 ( about 41% of the tota1 ) . The presence of the ulcerated stomatitis was associated with a more severe manifestation of the disease. A1l the sick cats were divided in to two treatment groups , A and B. The A group of 50 cats was treated with the traditiona1 treatment of antibiotics / Clavamox 1iquid oral 10mg / kg bw twice / day / and supportive therapy such as lactated ringer , cleaning of nose and eye discharge antibiotic eye ointment and force feeding as necessary determined by the licensed veterinarian. The B group 67 cats was treated with the cyanogenic composition 10mg / kg bw 2x / day inj. , and with supportive treatments of 1actated ringer , cleaning of the nose and eye , 2% sterile water solution of cyanogenic composition as eye drops and force feeding. The cats with stomatitis were separated into two treatment groups. About 4l% of the cats had stomatitis. The “ A “ group had 20 cats with stomatitis and 30 cats without stomatitis. In the “B” group 28 cats had stomatitis and 39 cats did not. The severity of the c1inical manifestation of the respiratory infection for each group was about the same. Recovery was determined by a person with no knowledge of the treatment groups. The pers0n instead only evaluated the symptoms or absence of symptoms and recorded the cage numbers , and assessed the cats as recovered or not recovered. The evaluator did not participate in the daily treatments. The evaluation was performed at about the same time every morning before treatments. Recovery criteria included the f0llowing : no fever , which meant below or at 102.8° F body temperature , eating without enticing or forcing on1y when food was. placed in the cage and observed the response , no coughing on s1ight tracheal pressure , no nasal discharge , active response to the evaluator. Group A control group : Mortality Rate 24% : 12 cats died / 9 cats with stomatitis. 3 cats without stomatitis / . 38 cats recovered. The recovery time varied between 9 days. _49_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. and 22 days. Average recovery time was 14 days. The recovery was determined by a person with no knowledge of the treatment groups and who only eva1uated the presence or absence of symptoms. Group B with the treatment of cyanogenic compositions : Mortality Rate 1.5 % : 2 cats died and 65 cat recovered. Both cats that died were 6 - 8 weeks old with tongue ulceration stomatitis. The recovery time varied between 1day and 6 days. The average recovery time was 4 days. Recovery was determined by a person with no knowledge of the treatment groups and who on1y eva1uated the presence or absence symptoms. Norovirus gastroenteritis is very similar to FCV and treatment efﬁcacy. Thus , putative norbirus therapies are often tested using the feline virus. To date no resistance against the inventive treatment has been detected on any bacteria1 , vira1 , or protozoa disease that has been treated. Treatment of humans and animals has been conducted in c1inica1 settings for a total period of four years in two different countries and in many different clinics. Many routine cases were treated successful1y and with a lO0% repeatability that was documented but is not 1isted below. The examples are not anecdotal in nature but rather conducted against the current1y available medical standard treatment as control. Current medical studies of effective treatments mere1y compare the efﬁcacy of a treatment with a placebo. The inventive medicament and treatment was. primarily aimed against diseases that have no currently good effective treatment. Example 9. Treatment of bacterial lung infection in a cat using a cvanogenic composition. The effectivness of a cyanogenic composition was tested on a 16 year old cat diagnosed with very severe bacteria1 pneumonia. The cat was not eating , was recumbent , coughing and dyspneic , with symptoms increasingly worsening for two weeks prior to treatment with the cyanogenic composition. The cat had been previously been treated with amoxicil1in , which resulted in a slight improvement fo11owed by a re1apse. The cat was admitted to an animal hospital and treated for seven days with 10mg / body weight Kg / day with the cyanogenic composition. At the end of the treatment the cat. was eating well , active , walking ﬁne. There has not been any relapse. _50 - . lO. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. Example 10. Treatment of protozoan parasitic infestation in a dog. An eight week old female immune compromised Chihuahua / runt of the 1itter was am emergency admission to an animal hospital. The dog was not ab1e to wa1k and was in 1ateral recumbence. Clinical symptoms inc1uded frequent vomiting and diarrhea. A diagnostic feca1 test identiﬁed a severe Giardia infection. Giardiasis is a protozoan parasites that typical1y lasts 2 - 4 weeks and can be resistive to treatment. The puppy was treated with 5mg / Kg / day injection of the cyanogenic composition and some supportive therapy. In ﬁve days she comp1etely recovered and her Giardia infection on a follow - up fecal test was conﬁrmed negative. The puppy was eating , . playful and very active by the ﬁfth day. Example 11. Treatment of a severe idiopathic neurologica1 svndrome in a dog. A one and a ha1f year old Chihuahua with severe neuro1ogical symptoms was presented in the hospital for treatment. The clinical signs were anisochoria / unequal pupi1s / , head tilt , proprioceptive deﬁcit , and seizure. The owner refused a diagnostic workup but insisted on treatment. The clinica1 signs indicated brain pathology and the relatively slow deve1opment that lasted two weeks prior to treatment and the gradually increasing severity of seizure and other symptoms and the age of the dog indicated infectious or parasitic origin rather than traumatic. The dog was treated with 10mg / kg / day of the cyanogenic composition in one dose subcutaneous inj ection / day for 6 days in the hospital. At the end of the 6th day of treatment the dog was comp1etely cured. The seizure , the head tilt the anisochoria and the proprioceptive deﬁcit symptoms disappeared. The dog was happy , active and eating wel1 , and was released from the hospital. A two week follow up conﬁrmed the comp1ete. recovery with no reoccurrence. Example 12 Treatment of combined viral , bacterial , and parasitic invention in a dog resistant to other treatment protocols with a cvanogenic compoisition. A six mouth old Shih Tzu presented at an animal clinic with very severe. cough , vomiting , diarrhea and severe lethargy. The dog was previously diagnosed in. - 51. 10. 15. 2O. 25. 3O.

Treatment was started with Azithromycin and C1avamox at therapeutic dose sin another hospital about 2 weeks previously , but the symptoms did not abate. The medication was switched to Enrofloxacin and Clavomox was continued. However , the symptoms continued to worsen to the point where the dog was so weak it could not stand. Kennel cough infection is a combination infection of Parainfulenza virus and Bordetel1a bronchiseptica bacteria. In this young dog a concurrent infection of bacteria , virus and 2 parasites was present and proved to be resistant to treatment with antibiotics but the inventive treatment cured the dog quickly. The dog was then treated with 10mg / kg / day inj. of a cyanogenic composition. prepared as described herein. The dog recovered quickly and comp1etely in ﬁve days. Example 13. Topica1 treatment of a bacterial ear infection using a cyanogenic composition for a bacterial ear infection. A ﬁve year old dog presented with a ye1low1eft ear and a pussy , smelly discharge. The ear was painful on exam with lot of puss in the ear cana1 . Aerobic ear cu1ture was negative for Coagu1ase and negative Staphylococcus and Beta Hemolytic Streptococcus. The treatment consisted of a topical application pr 3 —5 drops ( about 12 cc ) of 75 mg / ml water based of the cyanogenic composition app1ied twice daily. The so1ution was dispensed in a home treatment. A follow up revealed complete healing with no recurrence. The smelly , painful , and pussy discharge reso1ved within ﬁve days , a1though the treatment continued for ten. days in a form of topica1 ear drops and no other medication. Example 14. Preventing disease deve1opment in a unvaccinated tw0 month old dog that had tested positive with Elisa parvo virus antigen test using a cvanogenic composition. A two month old pit bull puppy with an appointment for its ﬁrst shots was suspected to have a medica1 condition because the dogs medica1 history revealed. two days of being 1ethargic anorexic , and its mother had not had vaccines. A parvovirus. - 52 - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. E1isa test was performed and was positive. The dog had not yet deve1oped the typical clinical symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea because of the very ear1y detection of the virus. Suspecting that the condition wou1d worsen , the poppy was hospitalized and received 10 mg / kg cyanogenic composition twice / day / 75mg BID / for 5 days. No vomiting developed , and the dog had one incidence of mild diarrhea on the second day. After the second day its appetite and general condition returned to normal. After ﬁve days of treatment the dog was released from the hospita1 and continues to be healthy. On follow up no symptoms of parvovirus gastro enteritis had devel0ped. Without treatment , parvoinfection in eight weeks or younger unvaccinated puppies born in a litter to an unvaccinated mother has 100% morbidity and close to 100% mortality with severe clinical symptoms of diarrhea , vomiting , anorexia with very fast progression to death. The fact that the puppy did not deve1op the disease other than a single incident of diarrhea in the second day , even though he was Elisa fecal test positive , shows the effectiveness of the cyanogenic composition treatment as a preventative. medicine. Example 15. Treatment of a bacteria1 bone infection in a canine mouth using a cvanogenic composition. A 13 year old mixed breed , 241b dog with ha1itosis and mouth bleeding and black stoo1s from swal1owing blood was presented to an animal hospital. Oral exam revealed severe periodontal disease of the right upper canine teeth a bone infection with ﬁstula and bleeding gum on the roof of the mouth. Dental work was scheduled , and an injection of the cyanogenic composition was given at 10 mg / kg dose. The dog went home with 5 tab of 100 mg / tab once a day. No other medication was given. The dog returned for denta1 cleaning and extraction 4 days 1ater. Under anesthesia the oral exam revealed a complete healing of the previously b1eeding gum and the fistu1a. The complete healing occurred only in 4 days - — the. infection had been cleared out of the bone. Example 16.

A two year old domestic short hair cat , six pounds , body weight , temp 102 ° F. emaciated cat came from a cat holding facility and was FIV and FELV negative. Its clinica1 symptoms : very severe wheezing respiration , very moist cough , frequent sneezing a11 day beginning 10 days previous1y. The cat had been treated in another hospita1 previously with antibiotics : ﬁrst , clavamox oral / contains amoxici11in and. with B - 1actamase - inhibiting effect c1avulanic acid known as for powerfu1 , broad - spectrum antimicrobia1 activity. Five days later treatment was continued with convenia injections , long acting broad spectrum fourth group cephalosporin , but the condition continued to worsen. CBC chemistry blood work was performed. The only abnormality was a 40% increase in Monocytes above the highest normal , and mi1d anemia. A cyanogenic composition was then injected into the cat at 33mg / kg one time and continued with 30 mg tablet / day SID orally , which represents 11mg / body weight Kg for nine consecutive days. Two days 1ater the cat was reported to be doing much better , with no more sneezing. Treatment with the cyanogenic composition worked instant1y , according to the owner , while treatment with the antibiotic therapy did not. Ten days later a follow up examination and vaccination was performed. The cat remained healthy , had gained weight , was eating we11 , and wheezing , coughing , and. sneezing was absent. Examp1e 17. Treatment of severe acute parvo virus gastro - enteritis in a 4 month old unvaccinated dog using a cyanogenic composition. A 4 month old 9.9 1b male dachshund presented to an anima1 hospita1 with vomiting and a history of bloody diarrhea for three days. The frequency of the vomiting was 12 times / day and diarrhea 2 times / day. An examination reviled lethargy , muscular weakness , and 6% dehydration. Abdominal palpation indicated signiﬁcant amounts of ﬂuid in the intestine. A parvo fecal antigen test was strongly positive. The puppy was hospitalized and put on iv lactated ringer ﬁuid therapy and 75 mg of a cyanogenic composition twice / day IM injections / represents 16.8 mg / kg twice / day dose / . The. ﬂuid therapy and the inventive medication continued for four days. _54_. 10. 15. 20. 25. 3O. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. In the ﬁrst day the dog had one mucosal b1oody diarrhea event. No additional events were observed throughout the therapy nor was any vomiting detected. After the third day the puppy become active and its appetite returned. After four days he was released from the hospital active and hea1thy. The dog remained hea1thy when returned one week 1ater for recheck and vaccinations. A fully developed parvo infection with prior art therapy takes 10— 14 days of suppOrtive therapy while the immune system copes with the viral infection. In unvaccinated dog the mortality rate is quite high. This example shows that treatment with a cyanogenic composition of the invention can reduce hospital stays more than 50% and. reduce the morta1ity rate close to 0 % with injection therapy twice / day. Examp1e 18. Treatment of severe septic fever in a cat with a concurrent maxi11arv bone infection. A cat reported by its owner to be four years old presented with a weight of 13.5 1b , symptoms of anorexia , with meowing from pain , weakness , and a putrid smell from the mouth. The cats temperature was 104.1 ° F and its pu1se was weak and rapid. A mouth exam revea1ed infection of the maxi1lary bone with a pussy discharge and odor due to periodontal disease. The compromised genera1 condition indicated a hand1ing of the septic condition before dental work with anesthesia cou1d be administered. The cat received one injection of the cyanogenic medicine 120 mg SC / 19.75. mg / kg dose / . The cats temperature was periodically measured to identify the effectiveness of the treatment. The starting temp was 104.1° F at 11AM. At 12 : 3O PM the temperature dropped to102.8 ° F. By 7 PM the temperature was a norma1 101.1 ° F. The cat was. more alert and responsive. Its pu1se was full and at a normal rate , indicating the reso1ution of septicemia. Treatment was successful without any other medication or. supportive therapy. Example 19.

A six old Yorkie 13.5 lb BW presented with recurring right ear pussy discharge and bad odor coming from the right ear. The ear was very itchy and the dog was constant1y scratching it. The dog had been suffering with this ear infection for about a year and a half with multip1e antibiotic treatments at other veterinary clinics with only slight temporary improvement. After the therapy ended the dog had relapsed quickly. A physical examination revealed a severe , pussy midd1e ear infection. The inside of the right ear had signiﬁcant swe1ling and redness. A cu1ture sensitivity ear swab was taken and processed by a diagnostics laboratory ( Antech ) . The cu1ture revealed : Aerobic Cu1ture and Mic from ear swab Organism : Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Heavy growth / sensitive= S ; resistant= R / .

The resu1ts from the ear swab indicated that this Pseudomonas was resistant to ten antibiotics and sensitive on1y for four antibiotics. In addition , mu1ti - resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa present a therapeutic chal1enge because of its tendency to form bioﬁ1ms that prevent even the best antibiotics from reaching the microorganism at therapeutic concentrations. The dog was treated by applying 3 - 4 drps of a 6% cyanogenic composition to the right ear twice / day for 10 days and 60 mg sc injection at the time of visit followed by 20 mg twice / day of ora1 inventive medication for 10 days. No additiona1 medications were used. Follow up : One day after the start of treatment the dog signiﬁcantly decreased scratching.

An eight year old Akita dog presented suffering from chronic , recurring prostatitis with typica1 clinical symptoms associated with the condition. Ultrasound exam revealed a 2x3 cm 1arge cavity in the prostate. The dog was treated severa1 times with different antibiotics 1ike enroﬂoxacin and clavamox and showed only temporary mi1d improvement , fo11owed by a quick relapse. This condition had worsened in the previous eight months , causing signiﬁcant suffering by the pet and frustration to the dogs owner. A cyanogenic composition was administered to the dog to attempt to improve the condition before attempting surgery. The dog was receiving 10mg / bw kg injection twice / day of cyanogenic composition in the ﬁrst week and showed an 80% clinical improvement. In the second week the dose was adjusted to 5mg / kg inj. twice / day. This resulted in a complete clinica1 recovery. After two 2 weeks of treatment an ultrasound exam on the pro state showed that the previous prostate cavity had shrunk to 1x1 cm. The treatment continued in the 3rd week with 2mg / bw kg dose twice / day. At the end of the third week the ultrasound exam revealed that the prostate cavity complete1y disappeared. The surgery was not performed since the comp1ete recovery and cure of the condition. A. recheck was performed three times over a two month period and showed no recurrence. Example 23.

Example 24. Treatment of Epstein—barr virus caused infectious mononucleosis in a human using a cvanogenic composition. A 54 - year old man tested the cyanogenic composition on himse1f for treating infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein—Barr virus. He was a practicing veterinarian who was fami1iar with the cyanogenic compositions of the invention , had used the cyanogenic compositions to treat anima1s with viral diseases , and had acquired conﬁdence in the effectiveness and safety of the treatment. He self medicated after ear1ier treatment he received was ineffective and even harmful. The mans disease condition started with fever , fatigue , and swollen lymph glands in the neck . The medical diagnosis was Epstein—Barr virus caused infectious mononuc1eosis. Initia1 treatment was with a 1arge dose of steroid / methylprednisolone / injection , which helped to reduce the severe lymph gland swelling in the neck. However , a side effect of the steroid and the concurrent virus infection prolonged the condition with severe fatigue , with overa1l worsening of the genera1 condition and severe pain. The condition within one week progressed to the point to near fainting. The veterinarian was admitted to a hospita1 where the diagnosis of Epstein—Barr virus caused infectious mononucleosis was conﬁrmed and he was given a prognosis of 2 - 3 mouth of debi1itating fatigue and slow recovery. The veterinarian started administering a cyanogenic composition to himself at home after he was released after 4 days of hospita1ization , during which time he had not improved. The dose used for self medication was 200mg 3x / day. The veterinarian ful1y recovered in seven days and did not re1apse in more than one year. No side effects were detected fo1lowing the therapy. with the cyanogenic composition. Example 25.

Cyanogenic compositions were oral1y administered to a human with a common cold and ﬂu. The treatment was taking place over three ﬂu seasons on a 54 years old male with 82 kg of bodyweight and no known medical condition other than frequent bouts of ﬂu in winter. Medical history revealed a tota1 tonsillectomy / pharyngeal and nasal / at age of 8 and frequent common cold or ﬁu episodes ( about 5 - 6 ) every winter . The frequency and severity of symptoms had increased in the past 10 years. The severity and extent of the symptoms was somewhat stronger then the typica1 cold due to the lack of upper respiratory protective lymphatic ring and the presence of two school age children in the household who brought home from sch0o1 new virus strains. Symptoms and progression and duration of the disease had not varied too much over the past 10 years except for a slight increase in severity. Symptoms followed a typical progression from the onset of the infection to recovery regardless of the treatment. A ﬂu shot administered to revent the frequent ﬂu instead caused severe ﬂu symptoms comparable to natural infection and with no signiﬁcant decrease of frequency or severity of subsequent ﬂu in that season. The course of infection episode started with inﬂammation of nasopharyngeal mucosal membrane the 1$t Day , continuing with inﬂammation of the throat and larynx mucosal membrane. Day 2 showed cough , sore throat , runny nose , and nasa1 congestion. During days 2 - 3 a severe tracheitis was present. The patient described this symptoms by. saying “It feels like my trachea was burned with a hot iron rod.” General symptoms , such as fatigue , loss of appetite , musc1e and joint ache , sweating , increased from the ﬁrst day to the 3 day signiﬁcantly and remained with the other co1d symptoms for 8—14 days. This patient over the past 10 years had tried every available medica1 and other a1ternative treatments to shorten or al1eviate the disease with no apparent beneﬁt. The cyanogenic composition was used to treat every episode of cold and ﬂu disease on this patient over three ﬂu seasons , tota1ing about 16 treatment regimens. The treatment started at the ﬁrst day of onset of inﬂammation of the nasopharyngea1 mucosal membrane. The tota1 dose administered was 200 mg 2 times per day / about 5 mg / kg. bodyweight per day / for the ﬁrst 2 - 4 days and continued with tota1 dose 100mg 2 times. - 60 - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014I024262. per day / 2.5 mg / kg bodyweight per day / for 2 - 4 days. This regiment was used in each app1ication to prevent development of ﬂu symptoms. No other treatment was applied. The treatment resulted in complete prevention of ﬂu symptoms. No cold or ﬂu symptoms have appeared in this patient for three ﬂu seasons when treatment was started at the early sign of the disease. Every treatment complete1y e1iminated the disease from the ﬁrst day and prevented its progression. The only symptoms detected were tiredness for 1—2 days , but the symptoms did not prevent the patient from working. No adverse reaction was detected during any of the 16 treatment regimens. No adverse reaction occurred during and after treatments. The patient a11owed the ﬂu to progress on four different occasions to a ful1 development of the disease as it described above. On the 3rd and 4th day , when the ﬂu symptoms fully deve1oped the cyanogenic composition was app1ied. For the ﬁrst 2 days the dose of medicine was 200 mg 3x / day , the 3 - 5 days 200mg 2x / day and 6—7 days 100 mg 2x / day was applied . The ﬂu symptoms completely resolved in 1—3 days after the initiation of treatment without any other medication. The grading of the clinical symptoms , like quantiﬁcation of sneezing time , nasal discharge , or grading of the general condition is very difﬁcult after administering the cyanogenic composition since the improvement is very rapid. In some cases I has taken only 2 - 3 hours it take to reso1ve 90% of the existing clinica1 symptoms. Thus , there have been no symptoms to tabulate. The therapy time generally needed to continue for about seven days. In the case 0f early termination of therapy , the ﬂu symptoms tend to come back 2—3 days following the last treatment. The common co1d and ﬂu is caused by vira1 infection of the respiratory tract and can be caused by more than 200 different type of viruses. The most common viruses. involved in the disease are rhinoviruses but also common are human Para inﬂuenza viruses , adenoviruses , picornaviruses , corona viruses , human respiratory syncytial viruses , metapneumoviruses , inﬂuenza A or B or C viruses. The current scientiﬁc literature agrees that there are no medications or herba1 remedies that have been conclusive1y demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection. The reason for this failure to cure the disease lies in the mu1tiplicity of causes and often mixed infection of different. viruses at the same time. Usually , vira1 medications on1y treat on1y certain viruses and are. _51_. 10. 15. 2O. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. ineffective for other types. The current inventive medications are not speciﬁc to a certain virus but are effective against very broad spectrum of viruses. Thus , any of the causative. agents of the disease can be successful1y treated. Example 26. Treatment of human respiratorv vira1 infection treatment in eight adult volunteers using a cvanogenic composition. The inventive medication was taken ora1ly by eight adult volunteers , mixed gender , between 22 - 75 years of age , in Budapest , Hungary. The treatment protocol was 3 - — 5mg / kg body weight 2 times / day for 7 days. The treatment was started 1 - 2 days after the onset of ﬂu symptoms. The result was a complete recovery within 1—2 days depending on the severity of symptoms at the time of the beginning of the inventive treatment. No side effects associated with the treatment were reported. The eight Volunteers requested additional cyanogenic compositions because of its effectiveness they experienced with. the treatment. Example 27. Treatment of a reccurring Candida albicans vaginal veast infection with a cyanogenic composition. A 35 year - old volunteer woman 57kg body weight with frequent recurring vaginal Candida albicans infection was diagnosed and treated by her gyneco1ogist over a period of 15 years. The reccurrence frequency was 2 - 3 ﬂare ups every year for the past 15 years. The gyneco1ogist ﬁrst administered lotrimazo1e ( brand name CANESTENTM oral capsu1e and cream ) for 5 - 7 days with a good symptomatic response. However , 3 - 6 months 1ater the infection wou1d again appear. Chlorhexidine wash was also tried to prevent recurrence to no effect. In the absence of an effective therapy to prevent the ﬂare up the volunteer app1ied a cyanogenic composition at a dose of 200 mg twice / day ora11y for 5 days with a complete reso1ution of the c1inica1 symptoms. No ﬂare - up has been detected for at least. three years. No other treatment was used since there had been no recurrence. Examp1e 28. Treatment of Herpes simplex labialis using a cvanogenic composition. —62 - . 10. 15. 2O. 25. 3O. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014I024262. A 38 year - old volunteer woman , 54kg suffered from recurring herpes outbreaks on the 1ip since aged 18 years. The outbreaks happened about every two years and were associated with immune compromised conditions like stress , concurrent upper respiratory infection and menstrual cyc1es. The outbreaks 1ast approximately 7 - 9 days and no spontaneous remission of an outbreak had occurred. The outbreaks always followed a predictable progression and included a ting1ing sensation , redness and swel1ing of about 5mm area on upper right side midd1e of the 1ip and 2 - 4 days after the onset blisters appear that turns into a scab that last about 5 days. The on1y medicine that could slight1y alter this course was Zovirax crema / acyclovir / if the treatment began at the ﬁrst sign of an outbreak. No other medicine had any effect on alleviating symptoms. With the treatment of Zovirax the b1ister size smal1er ( about 4mm in diameter ) and the duration of the outbreak was shorter ( to approximate1y 5 days ) . The cyanogenic composition was used to see if it cou1d obtain better results treating a new outbreak. Topica1 and oral cyanogenic composition medications were applied simu1taneously with no other medication. The topical medicine included 6% concentration cyanogenic composition in neutral ointment base 3x / day app1ied to the outbreak site on the lips and the ora1 cyanogenic composition was taken in a dose of. 200mg as one time dose. The result of the treatment : reso1ution of all symptoms and no progression of the. herpes infection in 2 days and no latent ﬂare up after the treatment stopped. Examp1e 29. Treatment of canine neurologica1 distemper infection with a cvanogenic composition. Two dogs presented with neuro1ogical distemper infection / / paramyxovirus / meningeoencepha1itis. The two were treated at separate times but are presented together since they had nearly identica1 histories. The dogs were 8 - 10 months old and adopted from a she1ter and had no vaccination history. A medical history revealed a mild respiratory disease 3—4 week prior to the symptoms of developing temporal musc1e twitching , leg muscu1ar twitching , hypersensitivity to touch and noise , and short 15—20 second seizures once or twice a day. The symptoms developed over a week with increasing intensity. Distemper titer IgG and. - 63 - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 3O. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. IgM were high1y positive. The absence of a recent vaccination resu1ted in a diagnosis of neuro1ogical canine distemper. The cyanogenic composition was administered at a dose of 15mg / BW kg injection twice / day for the ﬁrst week and 15mg / Bw kg once a day for the second week. This treatment comp1ete1y reso1ved the cIinica1 symptoms in one dog and about 80% of the symptoms in the other dog. The only remaining symptom was a slight twitching of leg and shou1der muscles in one dog. However , the dog was able to wa1k norma11y after treatment while walked with difﬁculty prior to the treatment. The causative agent of distemper I is very simi1ar nature to human measles virus infection / virologica11y and clinically. This suggests that the cyanogenic compositions can be usefu1 in treating human meas1es , which can cause encepha1itis in chi1dren and. adu1ts with high mortality. Example 30. Treatment of Malassezia pachvdermatis otitis in dogs using a cvanogenic composition. A ﬁve year old cocker spanie1 was diagnosed with a Malassezia pachydermaris ear infection based on a stained slide microscopic exam and s physica1 exam. The dog had a recurring ear infection with substantial itching and brown wax production , as wel1 as a strong sme1l and redness in both ears. The dog was treated using a cyanogenic composition. The treatment consisted of 3 - 5 drops of a 5% aqueous solution of the cyanogenic composition placed in each ear twice / day. The treatment was continued for 2 weeks. The clinical symptoms of itching redness of the ear subsided signiﬁcant1y by the 3 day of treatment and a1l clinical symptoms reso1ved by day 6 of the therapy. A two month recheck conﬁrmed the 1asting effect of the therapy. Example 31. Treatment of Trichophvton infection of the feet in human / Athletes foot / using a cvanogenic composition. A vo1unteer young swimmer volunteer with a severe itchy , scaly fungal infection. on the feet was presented for treatment. The infection was most severe between the toes. - 64 - . 10. 15. 2O. 25. 3O. W0 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. with some ﬁssure and red and inﬂamed skin. The treatment included 7% of a cyanogenic composition in neutral ointment base with DMSO. Approximately 30 minutes after the ﬁrst treatment the itching completely stopped. The treatment continued twice / day for ﬁve days in which time the scaling , redness and itching comp1ete1y reso1ved. No side. effects were observed during and after the treatment. Exmple 32. Treatment of a dog with chronic hepatitis , pancreatitis and acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis using a cvanogenic composition. A common denominator in successfully treated cases discussed in these examples is inﬂammation in the body. Inﬂammation in the body is caused by the innate immune system as a response to invading microorganisms. Inﬂammation is not a speciﬁc reaction to a speciﬁc micro0rganism but rather a general and uniform response of the animal and human body when cha1lenged by pathogenic agents 1ike bacteria , viruses , fungi , parasites , and protozoa. A cyanogenic composition contacting the inﬂamed area in or on the body gets enzymatically activated and turns into a therapeutic agent 10ca11y by releasing cyanide in a discrete amount that ki11s the pathogen. While not wishing to be bound by theory it is postulated that this is the reason for the wide spectrum and uniform workability regard1ess of the genus of the pathogens and this is the reason for the extreme low toxicity. To e1ucidate the toxicity 1imits of the cyanogenic composition , it was compared with known substances. - Tab1e salt LD 50 / Lethal dose on 50 % of recipients / 3000mg / kg - caffeine LD 50 150 - 200mg / kg - aspirin LD50 200 - 1200mg / kg. A cyanogenic composition was tested orally and by injection at a dose 5000mg / kg body weight. No c1inical sign of toxicity was detected. Therefore , the composition was considered as GRAS / generally regarded as safe / tested on mice. The animals also tested on autopsy and histological studies were made of liver , kidney , brain , musc1e , and pancreatic tissue. These organs did not show any pathological change microsc0pically or macroscopically after the animals received a 1arge dose of the cyanogenic composition. - 65 - . 10. 15. 2O. 25. 3O. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. Example 33. Treatment of chronic cholangiohepatitis in a cat using a cvanogenic composition. A cat with chronic cholangiohepatitis presented with jaundice , had stopped eating , and was very 1ethargic. Blood work showed e1evated leve1s of liver enzymes but no e1evation of white b1ood ce1l levels. A cyanogenic composition treatment regimen was initiated. After 2 - 3 days of 3X treatment at 10 mg / kg BID plus force feeding and ﬂuid therapy the white b1ood cel1 count increased signiﬁcantly ( to about 20 - 24 thousand ) . The cat started to eat by itse1f , the cats activity improved. The jaundice subsided and the other symptoms reso1ved. The treatment continued for 4 - 6 days. No treatment failures were reported , in contrast to. standard antibiotic therapy. Example 34. Treatment of a dog with inﬂammatorv bowe1 disease ( IBD ) and chronic enteritis with a cvanogenic composition. A dog presented with symptoms of chronic weight 10ss during the previous three months. Watery diarrhea 3 - 6 times / day was the main comp1aint and clinical symptom. The dog was treated with a cyanogenic composition 5mg / kg twice / day for 10. days. The diarrhea stopped and the dog gained weight. Example 35. Treatment of a cat with chronic glomeru1onephritis with a cvanogenic compos1tion. Chronic g1omeru1onephritis is a common disease in older cats. Symptoms include anorexia , anemia , weight 10ss , frequent urinating , and thirst. Blood work revea1s a BUN / blood urea nitrogen / 80 - 180 , creatinine 4 - 7 , phosphorous is often elevated and no elevation in white blood cell count. A cat with symptoms of chronic glomerulonephritis was treated with a cyanogenic composition iv or sc inj.10mg / kg dose BID for 2—5 days. This treatment usually increases the white blood cell count / mainly neutrophyls / t0 18 - 22 thousand. Treatment with the cyanogenic composition reduced the BUN 1eve1 about twice as. - 66 - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014I024262. quickly as did ﬂuid therapy and antibiotic therapy alone. The cats treated with the cyanogenic composition started to eat after two days and were sent home after 3—5 days of treatment. A follow—up check revealed the BUN leve1 signiﬁcantly improved to about. 30 - 5O depending on the initial 1eve1. Example 36. A cvanogenic g1vcoside composition - thiosu1fate supramolecular complex is resistant to bacterial enzvme hvdrolvsis / degradation and liberation of toxic cvanide. The use of sodium thiosu1ﬁte application to treat victims of cyanide exposure and the attendant cyanide toxicity is wel1 known in the medical ﬁeld. Large volumes of sodium thiosu1fate intravenous injection in a dose of 250mg / body weight kg are administered to a patient suffering from clinical cyanide toxicity. The mechanism invo1ved in the endogenous cyanide detoxiﬁcation is a enzymatic transsu1furation by a rhodanese enzyme to thi0cyanate , which is relatively non toxic. The cyanogenic compositions of the invention , in contrast , avoid liberating free cyanide with its subsequent detoxiﬁcation. Cyanogenic glycosides break down and 1iberate cyanide when mixed with a bacterial beta glycosidase enzyme to become toxic. Intestinal bacteria , for instance , can produce a beta glycosidase enzyme cause free cyanide deve1opment or , in a strong bacterial infection , like septicemia , cyanide 1iberation can occur inside the patients body. In fact , a lethal dose of 50% of recipient / LD 50 / of oral amygdalin is 400 - 900 mg / kg. according to scientiﬁc 1iterature. In contrast , supramolecular complex formation of cyanogenic g1ycoside compounds with sodium thiosulfate according to the invention avoids this potential toxicosis. This was illustrated in a contro1led toxicology study where 5000mg / kg caused no toxic events in mice fo11owing either oral administration or injection. Supramolecular complex formation was tested by the new complexs ability to resist enzymatic degradation and subsequent cyanide liberation in - vitro by bacterial enzymes. An in vitro test was performed to differentiate this extreme 10w toxicity from a detoxiﬁcation mechanism in the body versus from no cyanide liberation. The test was performed on : . 1. A non complexed cyanogenic g1ycoside and. - 67 - . 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. 2. A thiosulfate - complexed cyanogenic glycoside in separate test tube incubated with mixture of standardized intestinal bacteria culture. Free cyanide formation was measured. Test method : . First , test : three separate test tubes were set up each with : 5ml of cyanogenic g1ycoside / 200mg / 5ml concentration / was incubated with 13 bi11ion 1ive bacteria1 culture for 12 hours in a temperature of 35 C . After 12 hours the mix was centrifuged. and the top aliquot was tested for free cyanide concentration. Second test : Three separate test tubes were set up each with : 5ml of sodium thiosulfate incubated with a cyanogenic glycoside complex. The concentration of the cyanogenic glycoside was 100mg / ml and the concentration of the sodium thiosulfate was 25 mg / ml. The cyanogenic g1ycoside and sodium thiosulfate were mixed and incubated at 40° C for l2 hours before using it in the test. This incubation period was enough time for the supramolecular complex to form. From this so1ution 20c was mixed with 3 cc steri1e water and was incubated with 13 billion 1ive bacteria for 12 hours in a temperature of 35° C . After 12 hours the mix was centrifuged and the top aliquot was tested for free. cyanide. Bacteria1 cu1ture contains 13 bil1ion live bacteria such as : L. rhamnosus , L. casei , . L. acidophilus , L. plantarum , L. bulgaricus , L. salivarius , E. faecium , S. thermophi1us , . B. longum , B. breve. Cyanide testing was performed with a colorimetric test with the sensitivity of 0 , 01 - 0 , 20 mg / Liter free cyanide with the increments of - 0.00 , - 0.01 , - 0.02 , - 0.03 , — 0.05 , - 0.07 , - 0.10 , - 0.12 0.15 , - 0.20. Resu1t : ﬁrst test free cyanide ; - 0.1O , - 0.12 , —0.10 Second test free cyanide ; — 0.00 , — 0.00 , —0.00. - 68 - . 10. 15. WO 2014 / 165057 PCT / US2014 / 024262. C0nclusion : . The test resu1t c1early show that the comp1exed cyanogenic g1ycoside had no free cyanide 1iberation , whi1e the natura1cyanogenic glycoside deve1oped free cyanide after 12 hours of incubation with bacteria. This indicates that the supramolecular complex provides stability to the complex in the presence of hydro1yzing enzyme and interferes with the bacteria1 enzymes ability to breakdown down the molecule. Therefore , the very low toxicity results from the prevention of cyanide 1iberation rather. than from detoxiﬁcation.
