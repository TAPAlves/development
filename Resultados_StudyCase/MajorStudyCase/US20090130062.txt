[ 0001 ] The present inVenti0n relates t0 a n0Vel pharmaceutical use 0f a heparin - binding EGF - like gr0wth fact0r ( hereinafter t0 be abbreViated as “HB - EGF” ) 0r a nucleic acid enc0ding the same , and m0re speciﬁcally , use f0r the pr0phylaXis / treatment 0f a liVer disease. BACKGROUND ART. [ 0002 ] Pharmaceutical agents and treatment meth0ds f0r liVer diseases currently used in clinical situati0ns merely aim at sympt0matic therapy , and there is n0 deﬁnitiVe agent 0r deﬁnitiVe therapy that inhibits liVer damage ( hepat0cyte death ) and induces liVer regenerati0n. At present , theref0re , the primary 00urse 0f treatment f0r acute hepatitis is rest and diet. In fact , n0ne 0f the pharmaceutical agents currently in use has dem0nstrated true effectiVeness f0r the disease. In particular , alth0ugh Vari0us pharmaceutical agents and treatment meth0ds haVe been empl0yed f0r fulminant hepatic failure , the death rate fr0m the disease is still cl0se t0 70% , pr0Ving that they are far fr0m effectiVe pharmaceutical agents and treatment meth0ds. In Eur0pe and the United States , liVer transplantati0n is the ﬁrst ch0ice 0f treatment. [ 0003 ] As stated ab0Ve , in the actual situati0n , a deﬁnitiVe drug f0r liVer diseases ( particularly fulminant hepatic failure ) d0es n0t eXist at the clinical leVel. Under the circumstances , hepat0cyte gr0Wth fact0r ( HGF ) has been 00nﬁrmed effectiVe at the research leVel , and is eXpected m0st f0r practical applicati0n s00n. One 0f the present inVent0rs preVi0usly rep0rted that HGF str0ngly inhibits hepat0cyte death and simulta - ne0usly induces liVer regenerati0n after liVer damage in a fulminant hepatic failure m0del ( WO 98 / 24467 ; K0sai , K. et al. , Hum. Gene Then 92 : l293 - l30l ( l998 ) ; K0sai , K. et al. , Bi0Chem. Bi0phys. Res. C0mman. , 244 : 683 - 90 ( 1998 ) ; K0sai , K. et al. , Hepat0I0gy , 30 : 151 - 9 ( 1999 ) ) , andthe deVel - 0pment is 0ng0ing f0r the clinical applicati0n. ) . [ 0004 ] HB - EGF is a gr0Wth fact0r bel0nging t0 the EGF family , Which is als0 eXpressed in n0rmal liVer. It has bi0l0gically unique characteristics in that it is ﬁrst synthesized as a membrane - binding type precurs0r ( pr0HB - EGF ) , cleaVed by a speciﬁc metall0pr0teinase at the qutamembrane d0main , and the resulting s0luble HB - EGF sh0Ws a mit0genic acti0n 0n many types 0f cells. In the liVer , HB - EGF sh0Ws a sharp increase in eXpressi0n after hemihepatect0my , and als0 sh0ws pr0m0ted eXpressi0n in chr0nic liVer diseases. Based 0n these facts , HB - EGF has been , like HGF and the like , presumed t0 be 0ne 0f the hepat0tr0phic fact0rs. [ 0005 ] M0re0Ver , it has been rep0rted that the administra - ti0n 0f and gene therapy With HB - EGF sh0w a therapeutic effect 0n s0me 0f the 0rgan dis0rders. F0r eXample , it has been suggested that administrati0n 0f rec0mbinant HB - EGF ( including t0pical pr0ducti0n by gene therapy ) t0 damaged epithelial cells 0f patients With interstitial cystitis ( IC ) can bl0ck the effect 0f an antipr0liferatiVe fact0r ( APF ) causing epithelial abn0rmality in IC , and alleViate 0r rem0Ve chr0nic damage in the bladder epithelium ( WO 99 / 54706 ) . Further - m0re , an backWard injecti0n 0f an aden0Viral Vect0r 00ntaining HB - EGF gene t0 a diabetic m0use fr0m the pancreatic duct aff0rds gr0Wth 0f pancreatic B cells , differentiati0n 0f. May 21 , 2009. pancreatic duct cells int0 insulin - pr0ducing cells and impr0Vement in gluc0se t0lerance , suggesting that HB - EGF. sh0Ws a pancreas regenerati0n and diabetes treating effect ( K0zaWa , J. et al. , Pancreas , 3l : 32 - 42 ( 2005 ) ) . [ 0006 ] HOWeVer , n0 rep0rt has s0 far d0cumented that HBEGF actually sh0Ws a therapeutic effect 0n liVer diseases , namely , ex0gen0us HB - EGF suppresses liVer damage and / 0r induces liVer regenerati0n. M0re0Ver , alth0ugh HB - EGF is , like HGF and insulin - like gr0Wth fact0r ( IGF ) , kn0wn as a cardi0hypertr0phic gr0Wth fact0r , a gene therapy using HBEGF did n0t sh0W any therapeutic effect unlike use 0f HGF 0r IGF , in a my0cardial infarcti0n treatment test using rabbit c0nducted by the present inVent0rs. C0nVersely , it rather aggraVated rem0deling after infarcti0n ( Ushik0shi , H. et al. , Lab. Invest. , 85 : 862 - 73 ( 2005 ) ) . Thus , it seems that HB - EGF d0es n0t necessarily act therapeutically 0n all 0rgan dis0r - ders. [ 0007 ] As described ab0Ve , it is c0mpletely unkn0Wn whether 0r n0t HB - EGF actually sh0Ws a therapeutic effect 0n liVer diseases , n0t t0 menti0n the effectiVeness 0f its gene therapy Which pr0Vides n0 guarantee at all. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION. [ 0008 ] It is theref0re an 0bject 0f the present inVenti0n t0 pr0Vide a n0Vel and m0re useful pr0phylactic 0r therapeutic drug f0r a liVer disease ( particularly fulminant hepatic failure ) by identifying a substance that sh0Ws a str0nger liVer damage suppressing and liVer regenerati0n inducing acti0n than HGF d0es. [ 0009 ] The present inVent0rs haVe intr0duced and expressed an aden0Viral Vect0r c0ntaining a DNA enc0ding HB - EGF in an animal fulminant hepatic failure m0del and f0und that HB - EGF remarkably suppresses liVer damage and hepat0cyte ap0pt0sis and induces liVer regenerati0n. M0re surprisingly , the treatment effects 0f HB - EGF haVe been f0und t0 be str0nger than th0 se 0f HGF , the currently - kn0Wn m0 st pr0mising therapeutic drug f0r liVer diseases. The inVen - t0rs haVe 00nducted further inVestigati0ns based 0n these ﬁndings , and c0mpleted the present inVenti0n. [ 0010 ] Acc0rdingly , the present inVenti0n pr0Vides an agent f0r pr0tecting the liVer and / 0r pr0m0ting liVer regenerati0n , which c0mprises a nucleic acid enc0ding HB - EGF 0r a partial peptide there0f. When the nucleic acid is intr0duced int0 target cells by Way 0f , f0r eXample , a Viral Vect0r described bel0W 0r the like , int0 Which the nucleic acid has been inserted , it is intracellularly eXpressed t0 pr0duce and release HB - EGF 0r a partial peptide there0f , and suppresses liVer damage ( hepat0cyte death ) as Well as induces liVer regenerati0n. [ 0011 ] Theref0re , the present inVenti0n als0 pr0Vides an agent f0r pr0tecting the liVer and / 0r pr0m0ting liVer regenerati0n , Which c0mprises HB - EGF 0r a partial peptide there0f. The pr0tein ( 0r peptide ) can be pr0duced in large am0unts using the gene rec0mbinati0n technjque as described bel0W , and used. [ 0012 ] Furtherm0re , the present inVenti0n pr0Vides a meth0d 0f pr0ducing cells f0r pr0tecting the liVer and / 0r pr0m0ting liVer regenerati0n , Which c0mprises intr0ducing a nucleic acid enc0ding HB - EGF 0r a partial peptide there0f int0 cells 001lected fr0m an animal. By putting back the cells 001lected fr0m an indiVidual , int0 Which the nucleic acid has been intr0duced and wh0 se eXpressi0n has been c0nﬁrmed , t0 the indiVidual 0r implanting the cells mm a different indi - . US 2009 / O130062 A1. Vidual , liVer damage ( hepat0cyte death ) is suppressed and liVer regenerati0n is induced in the animal indiVidual. [ 0013 ] Since HB - EGF sh0Ws a str0ng liVer damage suppressiVe , ap0pt0sis suppressiVe and liver regenerati0n inducing acti0n , it pr0Vides a pr0phylactic 0r therapeutic effect 0n Vari0us diseases acc0mpanying liVer damage 0r hepat0cyte death by administrati0n 0f HB - EGF 0r a nucleic acid enc0d - ing HB - EGF.

[ 0133 ] Examples of preparations suitable for parenteral administration ( e. g. , subcutaneous injection , intramuscular injection , topica1 injection , intraperitoneal administration and the like ) include aqueous and nonaqueous isotonic aseptic injection liquids , in Which antioxidant , buffer , antiViral agent , isotonicity agent and the like can be contained. The examples also include aqueous and nonaqueous aseptic suspension 1iquids optionally containing suspension agent , solubilizer , thickener , stabilizer , preserVatiVe and the like. When the administration method is a topical injection around a target region , inj ectable liquids are preferable. AltematiVely , a sustained - release preparation can be prepared by using a bioafﬁnity material such as collagen. Since the Pluronic gel turns into a gel at the body temperature , and is present in a liquid state at a temperature not higher than the body temperature , HB - EGF can be topically injected along With a Pluronic gel and gelatinized around a target tissue to achieVe long - term sustainability. The protein preparation can be sea1ed in a container by a unit dose or plura1 doses like ampoules and Vials. In addition , HB - EGF and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be lyophilized and preserVed such that they only need to be dissolVed or suspended in a suitable aseptic Vehicle immediately before use. [ 0134 ] Since antibodies against a hepatocyte surface molecule can speciﬁcally deliVer a pharmaceutical agent into a hepatocyte , stability of HB - EGF in blood and efﬁciency in deliVery can be improVed by preparing an immunoconjugate in Which HB - EGF are crosslinked With the antibody. Examples of the hepatocyte surface molecules include , but not limited to , EGFR ( HER1 ) , HER2 , HER3 , HER4 and the like. When an anti - EGFR antibody is used , a nonneutralizing antibody is preferably used as an antibody for targeting so as not to inhibit signal transduction from EGFR. [ 0135 ] Although the antibody against a hepatocyte surface molecule may be a polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody , a monoclonal antibody is preferred. The antibody can be produced by a Well knoWn immunological technique. The antibody may be a complete antibody molecule or a fragment. The fragment may be any , as long as it possesses an antigen. US 2009 / O130062 A1. binding site ( CDR ) to the hepatocyte surface molecule ; examples include Fab , F ( ab ' ) 2 , ScFV , minibody and the like. [ 0136 ] The monoclonal antibody can be produced by cell fusion method ( e. g. , Takeshi Watanabe , Saib0yag0h0 n0 Genri to M0n0cl0nal - K0tai n0 Sakusei , Akira Taniuchi , edited by Toshitada Takahashi , “Mon0cl0nal - K0tai to GanKis0 t0 Rinsh0 - ” , 2 - 14 , Science Forum Publishing , ( 1985 ) ) . For example , a mouse is administrated subcutaneously or intraperitoneally 2 to 4 times With a target protein ( as necessary , the protein can be crosslinked With a carrier protein such as boVine serum albumin and KLH ( Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ) to form a complex ) being an antigen along With a commercially aVailable adjuVant , a spleen or lymph node is collected about 3 days after the ﬁnal administration to collect leukocytes. The leukocytes and myeloma cells ( e. g. , NS - l , P3X63Ag8 and the like ) are subjected to a cell fusion to giVe hybridomas that produce a monoclonal antibody against the factor. The cell fusion may be performed by the PEG method [ .1 Immun0l. Merh0ds , 8l ( 2 ) : 223 - 228 ( l 985 ) ] or by the Voltage pulse method [ Hybrid0ma , 7 ( 6 ) : 627 - 633 ( 1988 ) ] . A hybridoma that produces the desired monoc1onal antibody can be selected by detecting an antibody that binds speciﬁ - cally to the antigen from the culture supernatant using a Widely knoWn EIA or RIA method and the like. CultiVation of the hybridoma that produces the monoclonal antibody can be performed in Vitro , or in ViVo such as in mouse or rat , preferably in mouse ascitic ﬁuid , and the antibody can be acquired from the culture supernatant of the hybridoma and the ascitic ﬁuid of the animal , respectiVely. [ 0137 ] Considering administration to a human , hoWeVer , the antibody is preferably a chimeric antibody of a human and another animal ( e. g. , mouse and the like ) , more preferably a humanized antibody , and mo st preferably a complete human antibody. “Chimeric antibody” herein refers to an antibody haVing an immunized anima1 - deriVed Variable region W region ) and a human - deriVed constant region ( C region ) , and “humanized antibody” refers to an antibody Wherein all regions other than CDR are replaced With a human antibody. A chimeric antibody and humanized antibody can be acquired by , for example , cleaVing out the sequence encoding the V region or CDR from a mouse monoclonal antibody gene prepared by the same method as described aboVe , cloning a chimeric gene prepared by fusion of the sequence With the DNA encoding the C region of a human myeloma - deriVed antibody into an appropriate expression Vector , and introducing this into an appropriate host cell to alloW the chimeric gene to be expressed. A complete human antibody can be acquired by using a knoWn phage display library , or by using a human antibody - producing mouse deVeloped by Medarex , Inc. or a KM mouse jointly - deVeloped by Medarex , Inc. and Kirin Inc. [ 0138 ] Useful methods of crosslinking of an antibody against a hepatocyte surface molecule and HB - EGF include , but not limited to , the method described in Adv. Drag Del iv. Rev. , 53 : 171 - 216 ( 2001 ) . [ 0139 ] An agent containing HB - EGF for protecting the liVer / promoting liVer regeneration , Which has been designed to haVe the dosage form mentioned aboVe , can be dis solVed or suspended in a suitable aseptic Vehicle and administered orally or parenterally to , for example , mammals ( e. g. , human , rat , rabbit , sheep , sWine , boVine , cat , dog , monkey and the like ) . Examples of the parenteral administration route include intraVenous , intraarterial , intramuscular , intraperitoneal and intratracheal routes and the like. May 21 , 2009. [ 0140 ] The dose of the agent containing HB - EGF for protecting the liVer / promoting liVer regeneration Varies depending on the molecular Weight of the actiVe ingredient , administration route , seVerity of disease , animal species to be the subject of administration , drug acceptability , body Weight , age and the like of the subj ect of administration ; generally , the dose is Within the range of about 0.05 to about 10 mg / kg , preferably about 0.1 to about 5 mg / kg , as the amount of the actiVe ingredient , per day for an adult , Which may be administered at once or in seVeral portions. ( 2 ) Agent Containing Nucleic Acid Encoding HB - EGF for Protecting the LiVer / Promoting LiVer Regeneration. [ 0141 ] The nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF can produce HB - EGF for a long period due to prolonged gene expression and , therefore , is expected to exhibit a sustained treatment effect. Therefore , the nucleic acid can also be preferably used , in addition to the prophylactic or therapeutic effect on acute liVer diseases , as an agent for the prophylaxis / inhibition of progression , Which is used for preVenting exhaustion of hepatocytes and cell death associated With chronic diseases such as chronic hepatitis , liVer ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis. [ 0142 ] The nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF is preferably administered in the form Wherein it is carried on a suitable expression Vector. The expression Vector is conﬁgured at the position Where the nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF is functionally linked to a promoter capable of exhibiting promoter actiVity in a target cell of a mammal , Which is the subj ect of administration , or can be turned into a functional1y - linked form in a target cel1 of the animal administered under giVen conditions. Ihe promoter to be used is not particularly limited as long as it can function in a target cell of a mammal , Which is the subject of administration. Examples of the promoter include Virus promoters such as promoters deriVed from cytomegaloVirus ( CMV ) ( e. g. , CMV immediate - early promoter ) , promoters deriVed from human immunodeﬁciency Virus ( HIV ) ( e. g. , HIV LTR ) , promoters deriVed from Rous sarcoma Virus ( RSV ) ( e. g. , RSV LTR ) , promoters deriVed from mouse mammary tumor Virus ( MMTV ) ( e. g. , MMTV LTR ) , promoters deriVed from Moloney mouse leukemia Virus ( MOMLV ) ( e. g. , MoMLV LTR ) , promoters deriVed from herpes simplex Virus ( HSV ) ( e. g. , HSV thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter ) , promoters deriVed from SV40 ( e. g. , SV40 early promoter ) , promoters deriVed from Epstein - Barr Virus ( EBV ) , promoters deriVed from adeno - associated Virus ( AAV ) ( e. g. , AAV p5 promoter ) , and promoters deriVed from adenoVirus ( AdV ) ( Ad2 or Ad5 major late promoter ) , and constitutiVe protein gene promoters in mammal such as B - actin gene promoter , PGK gene promoter , transferrin gene promoter , and the like. “Being conﬁgured at the position Where the expression Vector can be turned into a functionally - linked form under a constant condition” means , for example , that as further described beloW , the expression Vector has a structure Where the promoter and the nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF are diVided by tWo recombinase recognition sequences con - ﬁgured at the same direction , Wherein the tWo recombinase recognition sequences are separated by a spacer sequence that has a sufﬁcient length to preVent the expression of the nucleic acid from the promoter , the spacer sequence is cleaVed out in the presence of a recombinase that speciﬁcally recognizes the recognition sequence , and the nucleic acid encoding HBEGF is conﬁgured so as to be functionally linked to the promoter. US 2009 / O130062 A1. [ 0143 ] The expression Vector preferably contains a transcription termination signal , i. e. terminator region , in the doWnstream of the nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF. The expression Vector can further contain a selection marker gene for selection of transformed cells ( genes that offer resistance against pharmaceutical agents such as tetracycline , ampicillin , kanamycin , hygromycin , and phosphinothricin , genes that complement an auxotrophic mutation , and the like ) . When the expression Vector has a spacer sequence sandWiched by recombinase recognition sequences as mentioned aboVe , the selection marker gene can be conﬁgured Within the spacer sequence. [ 0144 ] Although Vector used as the expression Vector of the present inVention is not particularly limited , examples of Vectors suitable for administration into a mammal such as human include Vectors deriVed from Virus such as VretroVirus , adenoVirus , adeno - associated Virus , herpesVirus , herpes simplex Virus , lentiVirus , Vaccinia Virus , poxVirus , polioVirus , sindbisVirus , and Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan. AdenoVirus has adVantages that it has extremely high efﬁciency of gene introduction , permits introduction into a nondiViding cell , the integration of the introduced gene into a host chromosome is extremely rare , and the like. Particularly , deVelopment of next - generation Vector named gutted ( gutless ) Vector , Wherein almost full - length of adenoVirus genome other than packaging signal ( 1p ) is substituted by introduced gene , has resolVed the problem of immunogenicity in ﬁrst - generation Vectors , and thereby long - term sustainability of introduced gene expression has been realized , Which results in further increase of usability of adenoVirus in gene therapy. Similarly , since adeno - associated Virus has comparatiVely high efﬁ - ciency of gene introduction , permits introduction into a nondiViding cel1 including hepatocyte , and it has been knoWn from animal experiments that expression of introduced gene on administration into a liVing organism persists oVer a long period , adeno - as sociated Virus is preferred as the Viral Vector in the present inVention. [ 0145 ] It is possible that constitutiVe oVerexpression of HBEGF causes a side effect in an anima1 into Which the gene has been introduced. Accordingly , in a preferable embodiment of the present inVention , the expression Vector is capable of expressing HB - EGF in a time - and / or target cell - speciﬁc manner in order to preVent adVerse influences due to an oVerexpression of HB - EGF during the period and / or at a site not in need thereof. As the ﬁrst embodiment of such Vector , Vectors containing a nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF functionally linked to a promoter deriVed from a gene that is speciﬁcally expressed in a target cell ( in the present inVention , the target cell is preferably a hepatocyte , but is not limited as long as the target cell can release soluble HB - EGF to deliVer same to the liVer ) of an animal to be the subject of administration can be mentioned. For example , as the liVer speciﬁc promoters , serum albumin promoter , cytochrome P - 450 promoter , and promoters containing a liVer - speciﬁc transcription factor ( HNF1 , HNF3 , HNF4 , C / EBP , and the like ) - binding cis - element , and the like can be mentioned. [ 0146 ] As the second embodiment of the time - and tissuespeciﬁc expression Vector of the present inVention , Vectors containing a nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF functionally linked to an inducible promoter Whose expression is transregulated by an exogenous substance can be mentioned. When the inducible promoter used is , for example , metallothionein - 1 gene promoter , expression of HB - EGF can be induced at any time in a target cell - speciﬁc manner by admin - . May 21 , 2009. istering topically to a location of target cell an inducing substance , including heaVy - metals such as gold , zinc and cadmium , steroids such as dexamethasone , alkylating agents , chelating agents , cytokines and the like , at intended time. [ 0147 ] Another preferable embodiment of the time - and tissue - speciﬁc expression Vector of the present inVention is a Vector haVing a structure Wherein a promoter and a nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF are diVided by a spacer sequence haVing a sufﬁcient length to preVent expression of nucleic acid from a promoter , i. e. , by tWo recombinase recognition sequences conﬁgured in the same direction. Mere introduction of the Vector into a target cell is insufﬁcient for a promoter to direct transcription of nucleic acid encoding HBEGF. HoWeVer , When a recombinase speciﬁcally recognizing the recognition sequence at a desired timing is topically administered to a target cell , or an expression Vector containing a nucleic acid encoding the recombinase is topically administered to alloW expression of the recombinase in the target cell , homologous recombination Via the recombinase takes place betWeen the recognition sequences , as a result of Which the spacer sequence is cleaVed out , the nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF is functionally linked to the promoter and a target cell speciﬁc expression of HB - EGF occurs at a desired timing. [ 0148 ] To preVent recombination by a recombinase endogenous in the subject of administration , the recombinase recognition sequence to be used for the aboVe - mentioned Vector is desirably a heterologous recombinase recognition sequence Which is not recognized by the endogenous recombinase. Accordingly , the recombinase acting trans on the Vector is also desirably a heterologous recombinase. The combination of such heterologous recombinase and the recombinase recognition sequence preferably includes , nonlimitatiVely , Escherichia c0li bacteriophage P1 - deriVed Crerecombinase and lox Psequence , or yeast - deriVed F lprecombinase and frtsequence. [ 0149 ] As a promoter for the time speciﬁc and tissue spe - ciﬁc expression Vector of the present inVention utilizing the interaction betWeen recombinase / recombinase recognition sequences , a Virus - deriVed promoter or a promoter of a constituent protein gene of a mammal is preferably used to ensure expression at a desired timing and site. [ 0150 ] The expression Vector containing a nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF can be produced by using a conVentional genetic engineering technique , cell culturing technique and Virus preparation technique [ for example , Current Pr0t0c0ls in M0lecularBi0l0gy , F.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA ( 1995 ) 92 , 2477 - 2581 , and the like ] . [ 0151 ] When a nonViral Vector is used as the expression Vector containing a nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF , introduction of the expression Vector can be performed by using a polymer carrier such as poly - L - lysine - nucleic acid complex , or by encapsulating the Vector in a liposome. The lipo some is a capsule composed of phospholipid With a particle size of. US 2009 / O130062 A1. seVeral tens to seVeral hundreds nm , inside of Which Vectors such as a plasmid encoding HB - EGF can be encapsulated. AltematiVely , Vectors can be directly introduced into a target cell by using the particle gun method. [ 0152 ] In the use of the Vector in Which the interaction betWeen a recombinase and a recombinase recognition sequence is utilized , When the recombinase per se is topically administered as a trans - acting substance , for example , the recombinase can be dissolVed or suspended in a suitable aseptic Vehicle and injected into a target site. On the other hand , When a recombinase - expressing Vector is topically administered to a target site as a trans - acting substance , the recombinase - expressing Vector is not particularly limited as long as the nucleic acid encoding the recombinase has a expression cassette that is functionally linked to a promoter capable of exhibiting a promoter actiVity in a target cell of subject of administration. When the promoter used is a constitutiVe promoter , in order to preVent the expression of the recombinase during the period not in need thereof , the Vector administered to a target site is preferably one rarely incorporated into a chromosome of ho st cell , including , for example , adenoVirus. As an altematiVe approach for alloWing the expression of recombinase at an intended time , the use of an inducible promoter such as metallothionein gene promoter can be mentioned. In this case , Viral Vectors With high integration efﬁciency such as retroVirus can be used. [ 0153 ] Also , the expression Vector containing a nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF can be , Where necessary , mixed With a pharmacologically acceptable carrier and formulated into Various forms of preparation such as injection and the like , and used as the aboVe - mentioned pharmaceutical agent. Here , examples of the pharmacologically acceptable carrier include , but are not limited to , those mentioned aboVe as preparations containing HB - EGF. [ 0154 ] An agent containing an expression Vector containing a nucleic acid encoding HB - EGF for protecting the liVer / promoting liVer regeneration is administered by either ex ViVo method Wherein the target cell of the treatment target animal itself or a cell from an animal ( allogeneic or heterologous to the treatment target animal ) is extracted out of the body , cultured , subjected to infection , and put back ( or transplanted ) into the body , or in ViVo method Wherein the Vector is directly administered into the body of the subject of administration to perform introduction. In the case of the ex ViVo method , the introduction of the Vector into the target cell can be performed by the microinjection method , calcium phosphate coprecipitation method , PEG method , electroporation method and the like. In the case of the in ViVo method , the administration of the preparation can be performed by , for example , injection , catheter , balloon catheter and the like. [ 0155 ] Dose of the agent for protecting the liVer / promoting liVer regeneration of the present inVention containing the expression Vector containing the nucleic acid encoding HBEGF Varies depending on the kind of Vector , size of actiVe ingredient molecule , promoter actiVity , administration route , seVerity of illness , the animal species to be the subject of administration , drug acceptability , body Weight , age and the like of the subject of admini stration. For example , When adenoVirus is used as the Viral Vector , since the safety Was con - ﬁrmed using 2><10ll particles / kg ( Virus particles ) in a clinical test of conVentional gene therapy for liVer diseases , this amount can be used as a rough standard dose. For example , the dose is about 2><l09 to about 2><10ll particles / kg , preferably about 2><10lO to about 2><10ll particles / kg , for an adult. May 21 , 2009. per day. Note that When HB - EGF is actually administered , HB - EGF gene does not need to be introduced into all hepatocytes since the liVer diseases are not congenital diseases and an amount not more than this leVel is considered to be sufﬁ - cient for practical purposes. On the other hand , When a nonViral Vector is encapsulated in a liposome , since the safety Was conﬁrmed by intraVenous administration of 666 ug of DNA in a clinical research using a cynomolgus With a body Weight of about 4 kg , this amount can be used as a rough standard dose. For example , the single dose for an adult is about 2 to about 10 mg , preferably about 5 to about 8 mg. [ 0156 ] The present inVention also intends liVer protection and promotion of liVer regeneration , and further , prophylaxis / treatment of liVer diseases , by potentiating expression of endogenous HB - EGF gene and actiVity of HB - EGF. [ 0157 ] As the means for potentiating the expression of endogenous HB - EGF gene , for example , administration of a transactiVation factor , Which binds to a regulate region of HB - EGF gene to actiVate the transcription thereof , a substance that stabilizes HB - EGF mRNA , and a substance that increases translation efﬁciency from HB - EGF mRNA , and the like can be mentioned ; as the means for potentiating the actiVity of endogenous HB - EGF , for example , administration of a substance that promotes production of actiVe form of soluble HB - EGF from pro - HB - EGF ( e. g. , speciﬁc proteases that are inVolVed in shedding such as ADAM , and the like ) , a substance that suppresses the decomposition of HB - EGF ( e. g. , protease inhibitors and the like ) , and the like can be mentioned. [ 0158 ] Accordingly , another aspect of the present inVention proVides a screening method of sub stances for protecting the liVer / promoting liVer regeneration , comprising selecting the aboVe - mentioned substance that enhances the expression of endogenous HB - EGF gene and the actiVity of HB - EGF. The screening method is characterized by culturing a cel1 that expresses HB - EGF by nature in the presence of and in the absence of a test substance , and comparing expression amount and / or actiVity of HB - EGF. The expression amount of HB - EGF can be examined at transcriptional leVel by using Northern blot or RT - PCR , or at translational leVel by immunoassay using an anti - HB - EGF antibody and the like. On the other hand , the actiVity of HB - EGF can be examined by inVesti gating the grthh - stimulating actiVity in a cell such as hepatocyte , or by using actiVation of EGFR family ( pho sphorylation of the receptor , and the like ) , Which is a target receptor of HB - EGF , or actiVation of a kinase molecule such as MAPK , Which is actiVated at the doWnstream of EGFR family , as an index. [ 0159 ] The thus selected substance mentioned aboVe , Which is capable of enhancing expression of endogenous HB - EGF gene and actiVity of HB - EGF , can be prepared , for example , as a pharmaceutical composition along With a pharmacologically acceptable carrier in the same manner as mentioned aboVe for the agent containing HB - EGF for protecting the liVer / promoting liVer regeneration , and administered orally or parenterally to a mammal such as human as an agent for protecting the liVer / promoting liVer regeneration. [ 0160 ] Dose of the agent containing the substance for protecting the liVer / promoting liVer regeneration Varies depending on kind and molecular Weight of actiVe ingredient , administration route , seVerity of illness , the animal species to be the subject of administration , drug acceptability , body Weight , age and the like of the subject of administration ; generally , the dose is Within the range of about 0.00l to about 100 mg / kg , . US 2009 / O130062 A1. preferably about 1 to about 10 mg / kg , as the amount of an actiVe ingredient , per day for an adult , Which can be administered at once or in seVeral portions.

Regarding therapeutic effects and phenomena , a signiﬁcant difference among any groups Was ﬁrst analyzed by AnoVa test , and subsequently an indiVidual signiﬁcant difference betWeen each tWo group Was analyzed by Student t - test ( asymmetric tWo - group t - test ) . A signiﬁcant difference in surViVal rate Was analyzed using Kaplan - Meier test. EXAMPLES Example 1 Construction of AdenoViral Vector. [ 0170 ] AdenoViral Vectors used in Experimental Examples described beloW Were produced as the folloWing. US 2009 / O130062 A1. [ 0171 ] Plasmid pADL. 1 / RSV ( B. Fang et al. , Gene Therapy ( 1994 ) 1 , 247 - 254 ) Was a plasmid produced by incorporating , from upstream , a 0 - 455 base portion from 3 ' side of human adenoVirus type 5 , Rous sarcoma Virus ( RSV ) LTR promoter , multicloning site , polyA signal sequence of boVine grthh hormone , and a 3328 - 5788 base portion from 3 ' side of human adenoVirus type 5 into pBR322 plasmid , and offered from Shu - Hsia Chen ( Mount Sinai UniVersity ) . The PADL. 1 / RSV plasmid Was digested With restriction enzymes Hind III and Not I and puriﬁed to giVe a Vector to be used for ligation. On the other hand , plasmid pRcHBEGF , containing cDNA of the full length of ORF of human HB - EGF in plasmid pRc / CMV ( InVitrogen ) , Was offered from Eisuke Mekada ( Research Institute for Microbial Diseases , Osaka UniVersity ) . The pRcHBEGF plasmid Was digested With restriction enzymes Hind III and Not I to excise the full length of HB - EGF cDNA , Which Was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis , and the intended DNA fragment Was recoVered from the gel and puriﬁed to giVe an insert to be used for ligation. The thus treated pADL.1 / RSV Vector and HB - EGF cDNA insert Were subjected to a ligation - reaction using T4 DNA ligase to obtain pADL.1 / RSV - HB - EGF. Furthermore , the pADL.1 / RSV - HB - EGF Was , together With plasmid pJM17 ( Micorobix Biosystems Inc. ) containing a gene other than El region of human adenoVirus type 5 , co - transfected into 293 cell by calcium phosphate method. This caused a plaque containing the correct intended adenoVirus to emerge by homologous recombination 10 to 14 days after the cotransfection. This plaque Was picked up , and the correct nonproliferating recombinant adenoVirus Ad. HB - EGF expressing the intended HB - EGF Was conﬁrmed by immunostaining using an anti - HB - EGF antibody ( M - 18 : sc - 1414 , SANTA CRUZ ) , and the like , after Which the Ad. HB - EGF Was proliferated by 293 cell , and concentrated by density gradient centrifugation in cesium chloride. The concentrated Virus Was puriﬁed With an Econo - Pac 10DG desalting column ( Bio - Rad Cat. No. 732 - 201 1 ) , eluted With PBS ( - ) , added With glycerol , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and preserVed at —80° C. When the Virus Was used , the particle Volume Was calculated , the solution Was diluted With PBS ( - ) so as to achieVe an administered Volume of 100 ul / animal , and the diluted solution Was administered. [ 0172 ] A recombinant adenoVirus AD. LacZ expressing LacZ gene of Escherichia c01i used for conﬁrmation of gene introduction Was produced by the same method as described aboVe ; details of the Ad. LacZ production method are described in Pr0c. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA ( l995 ) 92 , 2577 - 2581. HB - EGF is not incorporated into Ad. dE1.3 , Which is , therefore , a recombinant adenoVirus not expressing these genes at all. Ad. dE1.3 Was produced by co - transfecting pADL1 / RSV not inserted by HB - EGF and pJM17 into 293 cell as mentioned aboVe and folloWing the same method and the process. Human HB - EGF cDNA is described in Higashiyama , S. et al. , Science 251 : 936 - 939 ( 1991 ) , and Gene Bank accession number thereof is M60278 ( the same sequence as NM_00l945 ) . Experimental Example 1 Conﬁrmation of Gene Introduction into LiVer by AdenoViral Vector. [ 0173 ] AdenoViral Vector Ad. LacZ and Ad. HB - EGF ( 1><l011 particles ) prepared in Example 1 Were injected into 6 - Week - old male C57BL / 6J mice ( CHUBU SCIENCE Co. , . May 21 , 2009. Ltd. ; 10 animals per group ) from the tail Vein , and the expressions of exogenous LacZ and HB - EGF in the liVer Were examined by X - gal staining and immunostaining , respectiVely. The mice Were giVen general anesthesia With ether , and their chest Was opened , and their organs ( heart , lung , liVer , kidney , spleen ) Were collected. After the collection , the organs Were equally diVided into tWo ; one Was used for preparing an OCT specimen With a compound ( TissueTek OCT compound ) , and another Was , after ﬁxation With 10% formaldehyde , used for preparing a parafﬁn - embedded specimen. X - gal staining Was performed by ﬁxing OCT specimen section With 0.2% formaldehyde / 0.02% glutaraldehyde ﬁxatiVe for 30 min , folloWed by immersion in X - gal staining solution and a reaction at 37° C. for 24 hr. To perform immunostaining , the parafﬁn - embedded specimen Was ﬁxed With 4% paraformaldehyde for 10min , blocked With 10% skim milk ( SnoW Brand Milk Products Co. , Ltd. ) for 60 min ; subsequently , reacted With a primary antibody ( anti - human HB - EGF goat polyclonal antibody , R&D Systems Inc. , Minneapolis , Minn. Cat. No. AF - 259 - NA ) 100 - fold diluted solution ( 2 ug / ml ) for 1 hr , and Visualization of HB - EGF Was performed by labeling same With anti - goat Alexa568 ( MOLECULAR PROBES , Inc. , Eugene , Oreg. Cat. No. A - 1 1029 ) . Nuclear staining Was performed With a 1000 - fold diluted Hoechst33342 ( MOLECULAR PROBES , Inc. , Eugene , Oreg. Cat. No. H - 3570 ) for 5 min. Recording of obserVed images Was performed With a confocal laser microscope ( Carl Zeiss product number LSM5 lO ) . Results of X - gal staining and immuno staining are shoWn in FIG. 1 With a sample Which Was injected With Ad. dE1.3 from the tail Vein and treated in the same manner being an unstained negatiVe control. [ 0174 ] As FIG. 1 shoWs , since X - gal staining Was obserVed in 60 to 90% of hepatocytes from liVers of mice Which had been injected With Ad. LacZ from the tail Vein , it Was demonstrated that tai1 Vein injection of adenoViral Vector enabled efﬁcient gene introduction into a hepatocyte ( FIG. 1A ) . Furthermore , in mouse liVers into Which Ad. HB - EGF Was injected from the tail Vein , mainly expression of HB - EGF in cellular membrane Was obserVed and , hence , it Was demonstrated that an exogeneous HB - EGF With biological actiVity Was synthesized as a membrane - binding type HB - EGF , or a further processed soluble HB - EGF acted on a hepatocyte in an autocrine manner ( FIG. 1B ) . Experimental Example 2 Inhibitory Effect of. EleVation in Blood Concentration of LiVer Enzyme by Ad. HB - EGF. [ 0175 ] 6 - Week - old male C57BL / 6J mice ( CHUBU SCIENCE Co. , Ltd. ; 10 animals / group ) Were injected With a Fas agonist antibody ( anti - mouse Fas mouse monoclonal antibody , clone name , J o - 2 , Becktone - Dickinson Bio science , San Jose , Calif. Cat. No. 554255 ) from the tail Vein at 4 ug per animal to prepare a Fas - induced fulminant hepatic failure model. To inVesti gate the effect of preVention and treatment of fulminant hepatic failure , the adenoViral Vectors ( Ad. HBEGF , Ad. HGF , Ad. LacZ , and Ad. dE1.3 ) Were preViously injected from the tail Vein at 1 ><10l 1 particles per animal 72 hr before the injection of the Fas agonist antibody from the tail Vein. Blood samples Were collected at 24 hr and 3 6 hr after the tail Vein injection of the Fas agonist antibody ( 96 hr and 108 hr after the tail Vein injection of adenoVirus , respectiVely ) , the. US 2009 / O130062 A1. mouse Were sacriﬁced , and the organs Were collected ( the experimental schedule is shoWn in FIG. 2A ) . LiVer function , Which is an index of preVention of onset and treatment of fulminant hepatic failure , Was eValuated by measuring alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartic acid aminotransferase ( AST ) , Which are liVer enzymes in liVer. The measurement Was carried out using an automatic clinical analyzer Hitachi 736 ( Hitachi , Ltd. ) according to a conVentional method. [ 0176 ] As shoWn in FIGS. 2B and 2C , the results of measuring the serum ALT and AST leVel after the blood sampling demonstrated that at 24 hr after the tail Vein injection of the agonist Fas antibody , While the leVels of ALT and AST Were eleVated to 2240 : 450 and 1665 : 391 IU / L , respectiVely , in the Ad. dE1.3 - administered group , both the leVels Were not more than 230 IU / L in the Ad. HB - EGF - administered group , shoWing inhibition of eleVation in ALT and AST leVel. Furthermore , it Was demonstrated that in this inhibitory effect of eleVation in liVer enzyme in blood , HB - EGF shoWed the equiValent effect to HGF , only Which had been knoWn to shoW strong effect of preVention and treatment of fulminant hepatic failure. It Was also demonstrated that at 36 hr after administration of antibody , ALT and AST leVel Were decreased to not more than 500 IU / L eVen in the Ad. dE1.3 - administered group ; While in the Ad. HGF - administered group , there obserVed no signiﬁcant difference With this , in the Ad. HBEGF - administered group , the leVels Were not more than 250 IU / L , Which Were signiﬁcantly loWer than that in the Ad. dEl . 3 - administered group. From the aboVe results , it Was demonstrated that Ad. HB - EGF inhibited and relieVed liVer damage associated With fulminant hepatic failure , and the effect Was more potent than that of Ad. HGF. Experimental Example 3 Inhibitory Effect of Hepatocyte Apopto sis by Ad. HB - EGF. [ 0177 ] Hepatocyte death due to apoptosis , Which is a main pathology of fulminant hepatic failure , Was eValuated by performing HE staining and TUNEL staining of liVer tissues. Sections Were respectiVely prepared from the parafﬁn - embedded specimen and OCT specimen of mouse liVers at 24 hr and 36 hr after the agoni st antibody administration ( 96 hr and 108 hr after the tail Vein injection of adenoVirus , respectiVely ) , and subjected to HE staining and TUNEL staining. [ 0178 ] As shoWn in FIG. 3 , While in the Ad. dE1.3 - administered group , hepatocytes exhibiting typical apoptotic morphology accompanying inﬁltration of neutrophils and macrophages , corresponding to the eleVation in the leVel of liVer enzyme ( FIGS. 2B and 2C ) , Were obserVed at 24 hr later , in the Ad. HB - EGF - administered group , as Well as in the Ad. HGF - administered group , apoptotic morphology of hepatocytes Was not obserVed. Furthermore , at 36 hr later , While in the Ad. dEl .3 - administered group , dropout of liVer tissue due to progression of hepatocellular apoptosis Was obserVed , and also in the Ad. HGF - administered group inﬁammation Was obserVed , in the Ad. HB - EGF , disorder of liVer tissue Was almost completely inhibited. [ 0179 ] Furthermore , TUNEL staining Was performed in order to eValuate hepatocellular apopto sis in detail ; as a result , both at 24 hr and 36 hr later , compared to the number of TUNEL - positiVe hepatocytes in the Ad. dE1.3 - administered group , the positiVe cell number Was signiﬁcantly smaller in the Ad. HB - EGF - administered group and Ad. HGF group , thereby it Was demonstrated that in Ad. HB - EGF - and. May 21 , 2009. Ad. HGF - administered group , hepatocellular apoptosis , Which is an essence of fulminant hepatic failure , Was inhibited. Experimental Example 4 Promoting Effect of LiVer Regeneration by Ad. HB - EGF. [ 0180 ] LiVer regeneration , Which is an index of essential therapeutic effect of fulminant hepatic failure , Was eValuated With the ratio of proliferating hepatocytes identiﬁed by anti - Ki - 67 mouse monoclonal antibody ( clone name , TEC - 3 , Dako Cytomation , Denmark ) . Immunostaining With anti - Ki - 67 antibody Was performed using parafﬁn sections of mouse liVer at 24 hr and 36 hr after the agonist antibody admini stration ( 96 hr and 108 hr after the tail Vein inj ection of adenoVirus , respectiVely ) . [ 0181 ] As shoWn in FIG. 5 , While in the Ad. dE1.3 - administered group , Ki - 67 - positiVe cells , Which signiﬁes the grthh of hepatocyte , Were hardly detected both at 24 and 36 hr later , in the Ad. HB - EGF - administered group , as Well as in the Ad. HGF group , signiﬁcant increase in Ki - 67 - positiVe cell Was obserVed. Particularly , the ratio of Ki - 67 - positiVe cel1 at 24 hr later in the Ad. HB - EGF - administered group Was about l.5 - fold higher compared to HGF , only Which has been reported as a potent therapeutic factor for fulminant hepatic failure , thereby it Was demonstrated that HB - EGF had therapeutic effect for fulminant hepatic failure surpassing HGF. [ 0182 ] These results suggest that HB - EGF , Which is expressed in liVer after administration of the Ad. HB - EGF , be effectiVe in preVenting onset and progression of the pathology by strongly inhibiting hepatocellular apoptosis , Which is an essence of fulminant hepatic failure , and in inducing an essential healing by promoting liVer regeneration , speciﬁ - cally proliferation of surViVing hepatocytes. Accordingly , the pharmaceutical agent of the present inVention using HB - EGF can be also applied to any other diseases accompanying liVer damage ( hepatocyte death ) . INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY. [ 0183 ] HB - EGF exhibits strong actions of inhibiting liVer damage and apoptosis and inducing liVer regeneration ; therefore , HB - EGF or nucleic acids encoding same are extremely useful as a drug for preVention and treatment of Various diseases accompanying liVer damage or hepatocyte death , particularly liVer diseases such as fulminant hepatic failure.
