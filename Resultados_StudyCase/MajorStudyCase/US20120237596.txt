TECHNlCAL FlELD & BACKGROUND. [ 0002 ] M0st prescripti0n drugs and many 0Ver the c0unter pr0ducts c0ntain eXcipients that may a1s0 be referred t0 as inactiVe ingredients , such as p01ysaccharides and 0ther arti - ﬁcia1 additiVes. Many 0f these inactiVe ingredients are c0m - m0n1y added t0 f00ds by the f00d industry. F0r eXamp1e , many f00ds c0ntain artiﬁcia1 ﬂaV0rs , dyes , and 0ther additiVes such as Xanthan Gum and Vari0us sugars , Which are a1s0 f0und in medicati0ns. EXcipients and 0ther inactiVe ingredients are sOmetimes needed t0 de1iVer a drug With an active ingredient t0 the site 0f drug interacti0n When taken 0ra11y , Whether t0 faci1itate diss01uti0n , abs0rpti0n , distributi0n and eXcreti0n , Whi1e intraVen0us drugs d0 n0t require these inactiVe ingredients and theref0re sh0W relatiVely better and quicker resu1ts. The rati0 0f a drug and its eXcipients in additi0n t0 any f00d additiVes ingested may be imp0rtant With regard t0 the efﬁcacy 0f a drug , c0nsidering many eXcipients are the same as 0r directly 0r indirectly related t0 many f00d additiVes. [ 0003 ] These drug additiVes may result in unWanted impurities and c0nsequences. Metf0rmin , f0r examp1e , is meant t0 10Wer a diabetics bl00d sugar , but at the same time , c0ntains p01ysaccharides Which can haVe the 0pp0site effect. Warfarin is meant t0 thin the b100d but c0ntains m0diﬁed c0rnstarch , Which a1s0 has the 0pp0site effect. Furtherm0re the inactiVe ingredients may f0rm unWanted c0mp1exes With 0r With0ut artiﬁcial f00d additiVes after c0ntinued administrati0n. The pr0cessing 0f eXcipients may c0ntribute impurities and p0s - sib1y t0Xins t0 the medicati0ns. F0r eXamp1e , many starches and p0lysaccharides are Washed With ch10rine ( hyp0ch10rite ) , dextrins , ph0 sphates and 0ther synthetic acids and 0rgani sms. [ 0004 ] The medica1 ﬁe1d c0ntinues t0 rec0gnize the need f0r impr0Ving results fr0m drug therapies , in additi0n t0 impr0Ving the efﬁcacy 0f each drug. The 0bVi0us adVantage is t0 decrease the am0unt and time at Which the patient must be prescribed the drug t0 minimize any adVerse effects that may cccur. A n0Ve1 Way f0r making the medicati0ns p0tentia11y m0re effectiVe and hea1thier W0u1d be t0 inc1ude eXcipients that are pure , natural and p0tential1y nutriti0us. M0re imp0r - tant1y the patient is eXp0sed t0 1ess chemica1ly treated and m0diﬁed p01ysaccharides and m0re nutrients that haVe n0t been m0diﬁed. [ 0005 ] PreVi0us1y ingested f00d additiVes resulting in incubated and / 0r fermented st0red c0mp1eXes may further resu1t in free radica1 t0xin bypr0ducts When eXp0sed t0 re - administered eXcipients and / 0r artiﬁcial f00d additiVes. These pre - Vi0us1y ingested f00d additiVes may a1s0 c0ntribute t0 artiﬁ - cia11y induced tissue 1ayers and unWanted inactiVe ingredient gr0up ( llG ) c0mp1eXes that may remain st0red and / 0r1atent f0r additi0nal incubati0n and / 0r fermentati0n. The c0ntinued m0diﬁed and attenuated f00d additiVe and inactiVe ingredient c0mp1exes may a1s0 c0ntinu0us1y be re - actiVated and re - st0red. Many f00ds c0ntain chemica1s and / 0r t0Xins such as. Sep.20 , 2012. f00d additiVes. lt is We11 kn0Wn that many 0f these f00d chemica1s haVe been sh0Wn t0 be carcin0genic ( i. e. Saccharin and ye110W dye 6 ) . Many 0f these are referred t0 as f00d additiVes , artiﬁcia1 additiVes , artiﬁcia1 ﬁaV0rs , artiﬁcia1 c01 - 0rs , natura1 ﬁaV0rs and / 0r inactiVe ingredients , many 0f Which are f0und in tab1ets , capsules , 1iquid medicati0ns , candies and drinks. Starches , 0ne 0f the m0st c0mm0n drug and f00d additiVes are 0ften genetica11y engineered and chemica11y treated , 1eaVing many residues and / 0r c0mp0sites 0n the ﬁna1 pr0duct. Many pr0ducts a1s0 iist natura1 ﬁaV0rs When they a1s0 c0ntain chemica1s and may be prepared and diVided int0 sub types based 0n the am0unt and type 0f chemica1s used in each preparati0n. [ 0006 ] Chemica1 rings may be c0nsidered t0 pr0Vide surface area that may inV01Ve additi0na1 incubati0n and / 0r fermentati0n With different reacti0n times that may a1s0 be inV01Ved With different gr0Wth fact0rs. These chemica1s and / 0r rings may be inV01Ved With incubati0n and reacti0ns Whi1e st0red in f00ds , such as 1iquids , sO1ids and semi - s01ids bef0re they are ingested mm the human b0dy 0r any species f0r interna1 incubati0n and / 0r fermentati0n. The different incubati0n and / 0r fermentati0n mediums may be referred t0 as incubati0n and / 0r fermentati0n tanks. The incubati0n and / 0r fermentati0n phase 0r cyc1e and length 0f time the incubati0n 0ccurs sh0u1d a1s0 be c0nsidered , a10ng With the gr0Wth and / 0r precurs0r c0mp1eXes that may f0rm chemica1 predis - p0siti0ns. F0r eXamp1e , Vegetable fed beef and / 0r p0rk sh0Ws less chemica1 incubati0n and / 0r c0ntaminati0n than h0rm0ne 0r chemical1y injected beef 0r p0rk. BOVine and p0rcine deriVed insu1in are ear1y eXamp1es that resu1ted in chemica11y manufactured pr0teins. [ 0007 ] Starches are a1s0 genetical1y engineered and chemi - ca11y treated. Once ingested , their parent c0mp0und and / 0r by - pr0duct incubati0n and / 0r fermentati0n may 0ccur , c0m - p1eting and / 0r beginning an0ther f00d additiVe - inactiVe ingredient c0mpleX c0ntinued cyc1e. This cyc1e may be c0r - re1ated With the gluc0se cycle , g1uc0se being a maj 0r precur - s0r and / 0r t0Xin and / 0r t0Xin by - pr0duct substrate. [ 0008 ] These f00d additiVe chemica1s may resu1t in substrates f0r drug therapies , since many 0f the prescribed drugs seem t0 ﬁt mm a reacti0n With the f00d additiVe chemica1s , 0n1y targeting a p0rti0n 0f an incubated and / 0r fermented deVe10ped aggregated mass. The p0rti0n 0f the incubated deVe10ped aggregated mass may c0rre1ate With the m0lar mass Value 0f a drug , f00d additiVe and / 0r inactiVe ingredient 0r inactiVe ingredient c0mp1eX. Whether these f00d additiVes are artiﬁcia1 pr0teins , starches and / 0r b0th , they may resu1t in an incubated and / 0r fermented c0mp1eX that may sh0W different gr0Wth characteristics , Whether deVe10ping int0 What is VieWed 0n a b0dy part surface , such as a b100d Vesse1 , as a m0diﬁed recept0r site f0r drugs , 0r any 0ther gr0Wth characteristic Variati0ns , such as a tum0r 0n an 0rgan 0r a b100d b0und pr0tein c0mp1eX thats serVes as a carrier f0r b100d t0xin transp0rt. [ 0009 ] S0me drug therapies use the terms Viruses and bacteria t0 subcateg0rize treatments and different diseases , Whi1e 0thers use the aut0n0mic nerV0us system as the basis 0f many 0ther therapies. Many 0f the drug rings and side gr0ups c0r - re1ate With the chemica1 structure 0f f00d additiVes. The term “inactiVe ingredient—f00d additiVe gr0up c0mpleX” may be c0nsidered f0r the different types 0f diseases and c0nditi0ns. Questi0ns such as What type 0f inactiVe ingredient 0r f00d additiVe c0mp1eX an indiVidua1 acquires , Where the inactiVe ingredient 0r f00d additiVe c0mp1eXes are st0red and h0W.

Using terms pertaining t0 chemica1 c0mp1eXes , such as inactiVe ingredient f00d additiVe group c0mp1eXes and m01ar mass aggregates , instead 0f 0rganisms may a1s0 better ﬁt the percepti0n and / 0r p0int 0f VieWs 0f many enVir0nmen - ta1ists and t0Xic010gists When discussing these drug therapies. [ 0010 ] Many indiVidua1s With natura1 f00d 0r Vegetab1e a11ergies 1eam that it may n0t be the actua1 rea1 natura1 Vegetab1e 0r fruit that a pers0n is a11ergic t0 , but rather by - pr0ducts and break - up pr0ducts that resu1t fr0m the fruit and Vegetab1e breakd0Wn and e1iminati0n 0f chemica1 t0Xins fr0m any present inactiVe ingredients 0r f00d additiVe c0m - p1eXes. F0r eXamp1e , some patients are diagn0sed as being a11ergic t0 a Vegetab1e such as c0rn 0r t0mat0 , When in fact they are n0t.

The adVantage is t0 decrease the am0unt and time at Which the patient must be prescribed the drug t0 minimize any adVerse effects that may 0ccur. lncreasing the am0unt 0f nutrients mm a t0xin 1ayer Where a drug penetrates may haVe signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁts and may be c0rre1ated With the healing 0f any damaged and / 0r artiﬁcia11y induced c0ntaminated tissue gr0Wth. M0re imp0rtant1y the patient is exp0sed t0 1ess p01ysaccharides and m0re nutrients. Since many f00ds c0ntain simi1ar additiVes t0 th0se f0und in drugs , a decrease in the am0unt 0f c0mm0n1y used inactiVe ingredients may c0rre1ate With a decrease in the f0rmati0n 0f additi0na1 t0Xin 1ayer tissue , resu1ting in a thinner t0Xin 1ayer , in turn a110Wing a quicker drug penetrati0n , since the p01ysaccharide 1ayers and c0m - p1exes are What the drug penetrates. [ 0012 ] SeVera1 drug f0rmu1ati0ns haVe been created in an attempt t0 increase the de1iVery and efﬁcacy 0f drugs. The need f0r c0ntinued manufacturing 0f neW drugs may resu1t fr0m the c0ntinued f00d c0nsumpti0n and drug re - administrati0n 0f inactiVe ingredients t0 patients. By inc1uding 1ess m0diﬁed p01ysaccharide starches and n0n - genetica11y and chemica11y treated additiVes , the patient may be 1ess 1ike1y t0 sh0W adVerse and side effects and in turn may eXperience quicker tissue hea1ing.
