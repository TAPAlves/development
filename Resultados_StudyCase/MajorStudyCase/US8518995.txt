The present techn010gy relates t0 c0mp0siti0ns , deVices and meth0ds f0r the treatment 0f irritab1e b0We1 syndr0me and is genera11y re1ated t0 the ﬁe1d 0f medicine , pharmac01 - 0gy , m01ecu1ar bi010gy , and chemistry. BACKGROUND OF THE lNVENTlON. lrritab1e b0We1 syndrome ( lBS ) is 0ne 0f the c0mm0n ai1ments 0f the b0We1 ( intestines ) and affects an estimated 1 5% 0f pe0p1e in the US. Other names f0r lBS inc1ude , but are n0t 1imited t0 , spastic 0010n , spastic c01itis , and muc0us c01i - tis. lBS may be due t0 the abn0rma1 functi0n 0f the musc1es 0f the 0rgans 0f the gastr0intestinal tract 0r the nerVes c0ntr01 - ling the 0rgans. The abn0rma1 functi0n 0f the nerV0us system in lBS may 0ccur in a gastr0intestinal muscular 0rgan , the spina1 00rd , 0r the brain. The abn0rma1ities may 0ccur in the sens0ry nerVes , the m0t0r nerVes , 0r at pr0cessing centers in the intestine , spinal c0rd , 0r brain. N0rma1 actiVities , such as stretching 0f the sma1l intestine by f00d , may giVe rise t0 abn0rmal sens0ry signals that are sent t0 the spinal c0rd and brain , Where they are perceiVed as pain. Abn0rma1 c0mmands thr0ugh the m0t0r nerVes may a1s0 pr0duce a painfu1 spasm ( c0ntracti0n ) 0f the musc1es. Theref0re , lBS may be due t0 sens0ry dysfuncti0n , m0t0r dysfuncti0n , 0r b0th sens0ry and m0t0r dysfuncti0n. lBS n0rmal1y causes cramping , abd0minal pain , bl0ating , c0nstipati0n , diarrhea , etc. lBS may n0t 1ead t0 m0re seri0us c0nditi0ns in m0st patients , but it is a s0urce 0f chr0nic pain , . OH. HO. ( R ) . . OH. fatigue and 0ther sympt0ms. lt increases a patients medical c0st and may c0ntribute t0 W0rk absenteeism. The high preVa - 1ence 0f lBS in c0njuncti0n With increased c0sts may pr0duce a disease With a high s0cieta1 c0st. lt is a1s0 regarded as a chr0nic i11ness and can dramatica11y affect the qua1ity 0f a sufferers 1ife. Thus , there eXists a need f0r an effectiVe and safe treatment 0f irritab1e b0We1 syndr0me. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 60. 65. 2 SUMMARY OF THE lNVENTlON.

Experimental Design. After a 12 h0urs fast , a11 subjects underg0 sigm0id0sc0py With0ut air insufflati0ns. A pr0be With 0ne t0 three p01yeth - y1ene catheters is inserted thr0ugh the sigm0id0 sc0pe s0 that the pr0ximal catheter is ab0ut 18 - 2O centimeter ( cm ) fr0m the ana1 margin , the tip 0f the sec0nd catheter ab0ut 5 cm be10W , and the third catheter is p0siti0ned just inside the internal sphincter. An ab0ut 5 - cm - 10ng ba1100n surr0unds each 0f the tW0 dista1 catheters. The distal bal100n is inflated With ab0ut 20 mi11i1iter ( mL ) 0f air t0 preVent the deVice fr0m m0Ving in the dista1 directi0n.

Each subject has the same ba1100n V01ume during the three examinati0ns. lntra - 1umina1 pres sure is measured fr0m the pr0xima1 rec - ta1 ba1100n and the sigm0id catheter ( inside diameter , ab0ut 1.67 mil1imeter ( mm ) ) , Which is 0pen tipped With a side 0riﬁce 0f ab0ut 1.5 mm diameter. The catheter is c0ntinu0usly perﬁised With b0dy - temperature Water at 3.5 mL / h by means 0f an infusi0n pump.

After an initial rest peri0d 0f 3O minutes ( min ) , pressure is quantiﬁed f0r three peri0ds 0f 25 min. The ﬁrst peri0d , designated the c0ntr01 peri0d , is preceded by sa1ine infusi0n , 1 mL / min , f0r 5 min.

The sigm0id m0tility index Varies c0nsiderably betWeen the subjects and in the same subject 0n the different days. The m0t0r actiVity c0nsists main1y 0f three different types 0f m0t0r WaVes. The c0mm0nest f0rm is pressure WaVes With a frequency 0f 2 - 3 / min. The amp1itude is genera11y betWeen 1 and 4 kPa , and the durati0n 0f each WaVe 10 - 25 sec0nds ( sec ) . BetWeen these pr0minent WaVes , 0ther WaVes With lOW amp1i - tude and a frequency 0f 6 - 8 / min may 0ccur. ln peri0ds With high m0t0r actiVity , the base - 1ine pressure may 0ften increase , With c1usters 0f 3 / min WaVes and superimp0sed sma11 7 / min WaVes. After placeb0 inﬁ13i0n , c0ntracti1e actiVity has a tendency t0 increase in WaVe frequency , durati0n , and amp1itude. Resu1ts sh0W that sigm0id m0ti1ity increases in subjects. Effects 0f MN - 221. During the c0ntr01 peri0d bef0re MN - 221 infusi0n the m0tility index is ca1cu1ated. After O.5O mi1ligram ( mg ) 0f MN - 221 administered intraVen0us1y , the mean m0ti1ity index decreases by m0re than ab0ut 50% c0mpared With the c0ntr01 peri0d. After MN - 221 in a t0ta1 d0se 0f 1 0 mg is administered intraVen0usly , the m0ti1ity index decreases ﬁirther. Results sh0W that sigm0id m0tility decreases in subjects. Recta1 M0ti1ity.

The present study sh0Ws that administrati0n 0f MN - 221 signiﬁcant1y decreases sigm0id c010nic m0ti1ity in subjects With the lBS. After p1aceb0 inﬁisi0n , m0ti1ity has a tendency t0 increase during the test peri0d , further emphasizing the inhibit0ry effect 0f MN - 221. The p1asma c0ncentrati0ns 0f MN - 221 are 0bserVed t0 be Within the therapeutic 1eVe1s used in clinica1 practice. Recta1 m0ti1ity is registered fr0m an air inﬁated ba1100n.

MN - 221 inhibits es0phagea1 peristalsis and t0ne 0f the 10Wer es0phagea1 sphincter in subjects suffering fr0m lBS. This study inVestigates the inhibit0ry inﬁuence 0f beta - 2 - adrenergic stimu1ati0n by MN - 221 0n es0phagea1 m0ti1ity With 1itt1e t0 n0 incidence 0f signiﬁcant adVerse side effects. ln the study , es0phagea1perista1sis is studied in subjects suffering fr0m lBS.

The b100d picture , erythr0 - cyte sedimentati0n rate , and results 0f sigm0id0sc0py , rectal bi0psy , and barium enema are n0rma1 in al1 subjects. The sympt0ms 0f the subjects , inc1uding dysphagia and heartburn , are rec0rded 0n data sheets f0r c0rrelati0n With man0 - metric ﬁndings. Each subject is 0ra11y giVen MN - 221 , 5 mg three times daily , f0r 10 days. The subjects are studied bef0re medicati0n ( basal ) , 0n days 3 and 10 during the medicati0n , and 1 Week after WithdraWa1 0f the drug. At each sessi0n es0phagea1 peristaltic pressure , heart rate , and ﬁnger trem0r are assessed. Es0phagea1 Measurements. Man0metric studies are perf0rmed With a trip1e - 1umen tube With each channel perfused With Water , O.5 m1 / min , Via a 10W - c0mp1iance capi11ary system. The channe1s are c0n - nected t0 pressure transducers With rec0rding 0n a Grass p01ygraph. The pressure rec0rding sites are ab0ut 8 cm apart. After an 0Vernight fast , the subjects are examined seated in a standardized p0 siti0n With the man0metric pr0be inserted Via the nasa1 r0ute. The pr0be is p1aced With the dista1 rec0rding p0int ab0ut 2 cm pr0xima1 t0 the loWer es0phageal sphincter ( LES ) . Thus , pressure is rec0rded ab0ut 18 cm pr0xima1 t0 the LES ( pr0xima1 es0phagus ) , ab0ut 10 cm pr0xima1 t0 the LES ( midd1e es0phagus ) , and ab0ut 2 cm pr0xima1 t0 the LES ( dista1 es0phagus ) .

The p1asma c0ncentrati0n 0f MN - 221 is determined by 1iquid chr0mat0graphy plus mass spectr0metry. AdVerse Reacti0ns. Tachycardia and trem0r are classiﬁed in acc0rdance With a f0ur - degree scale : absent , slight ( n0t disturbing ) , m0derate ( disturbing , but n0t disab1ing ) , and seVere ( disab1ing ) . Resu1ts Es0phagea1 Perista1sis. Ora1 administrati0n 0f MN - 221 resu1ts in a signiﬁcant decrease 0f es0phagea1 perista1tic pressure.

The extraintestinal Variables , heart rate and ﬁnger trem0r , d0 n0t change during MN - 221 medicati0n. Thus , b0th heart rate and trem0r stay sub stantia11y the same as bef0re medica - ti0n. At the end 0f the medicati0n peri0d , such as 0n day 10 , n0 signiﬁcant changes in the heart rate 0r ﬁnger trem0r are seen.
