The invention re1ates to a po1ysaccharide—peptide conjugate wherein the po1ysaccharide is advantageous1y immunogenic , which comprises a polysaccharide chain composed of repeat units and a p1ura1ity of peptide moieties , each moiety containing a cysteine residue and being covalent1y attached at random along the polysaccharide chain , through an indirect bound involving the thiol group of the cysteine residue and an amino , hydroxyl or carboxy1 group of the po1ysaccharide , said indirect bound being achieved through either a linker or a spacer - Jinker moiety provided that the spacer entity of the spacer—1inker moiety is Iinked to the amino , hydroxyl or carboxy1 group of the polysaccharide. To this end , a usefu1 iinker may be e. g. , N—— ( 7—ma1eimidobutyry1oxy ) succinimide ester. Such a conjugate may typical1y exhibit a "Rake" conﬁguration. Conjugation processes are also disclosed. Conjugates of the invention are in panicu1ar usefu1 in the vaccina1 ﬁe1d to elicit a protective long term immune response against a pathogenic microorganism from which the immunogenic polysaccharide is derived. . . 10. 15. 20. 25. 3O. 35. CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - lS. WO 98 / 31393 PCT / EP98 / 00654. _1_. Polysaccharide - Peptide C0nj ugates. The present invention relates to a po1ysaccharide peptide conjugate and a process for making it. In a particu1ar embodiment of the invention , the conjugate uses bacteria1 or fungal polysaccharides and thus can be useful for vaccine purposes. Po1ysaccharides constitute a broad family of polymeric molecules which are usefu1 in various technieal ﬁelds. In some cases , they require to be coupled to a polypeptide , e. g. protein or peptide. For examp1e , polysaccharides are used in diagnosis or purification technics as a matrix medium for peptide reagents. Non - immunogenic polysacchar1des such as dextran , are also useful to present small peptides , to the immune syst6m as described in EP 326 111. 1ndeed , peptides have to be 11nked to protein carriers or have to b6 administered with an adjuvant , the most common1y used adjuvants being aluminium compounds. However , small peptides mixed , adsorbed or precipitated with these adjuvants may be hindered by the aluminium gel and therefore , not available to the immune system. To overcome this problem , EP 326 111 teaches that peptides may be conjugated to non - immunogenic polysaccharides. Such conjugates , in the presence of aluminium compounds , are able to elicit an immune response against the peptide moiety. In the vaccina1 ﬁe1d , it is also highly interesting to conjugate po1ypeptides e. g. , peptide or protein , to immunogenic polysaccharides , this once pursuing an immune response to the po1ysaccharides. Indeed , eapsule and cell wall of bacteria ( and also cel1 wa1l of fungi ) are essentia1ly constituted by po1ysaccharides composed of very speciﬁc repeat units that bear epitope motives that are usually not found in mamma1s and can mediate immunogenicity. Therefore , polysaccharides e. g. , capsular po1ysaccharides have been a1ready used as vaccines against bacterial diseases such as meningitis , pneumonia and typhoid fever. However , there is a major problem when using polysaccharides as vaccines. Although they have been proven immunogenic i. e. , in other words , they 61icit an immune response when administ6red as such to a mammal , even if this response may be poor , they are specific in that they belong to the small number of antigens that are abIe to induce B - cel1s production without help from T - cells. Accordingly , they are cal1ed T - independent. ' . . lO. 15. 20. 25. 3O. 35. CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - ls. W0 98 / 31393 PCT [ EP98 / 00654. ..2_. The immune response induced by T - independent antigens is characterized by a number of features , among which : . ( i ) The primary response is weaker and earlier than the response to T - dependent antigens ; . ( ii ) The antibody response does not mature int0 high IgG pr0duction , with affinity increase , as observed with T—dependent antigens ; . ( iii ) The immune memory corresponding to T—independent antigens is poor and thus , as the immune memory is the key of the sec0ndary immune response that constitutes the basis of the vaccination principle , a T - independent antigen is a poor antigen for inducing a long term protective immune response ; and. ( iv ) Infants are unab1e to respond to po1ysaccharides before one or two years of age. In order to induce a secondary immune response , T—independent antigens require to be cova1ent1y coup1ed to a carrier protein such as diphtheria or tetanus toxin , which give the antigen the T - dependent character. The conjugate thereof may then be complemented with an adjuvant such as an a1uminium compound or the complete or incomplete Freund ' s adjuvant ( these two latter , exclusive1y for use in mamma1s other than humans ) , so that the immune response is enhanced ( adjuvant effect ) . By the term "carrier" is meant a molecule that , when cova1ently 1inked to an antigen e. g. a polysaccharide , is capable of promoting a T—dependent response to the antigen. Such a response is shown upon a vaccination scheme comprising at least two injections of the antigen - carrier conjugate , at days , weeks or months apart ( priming and booster ) . Upon the first infection ( priming ) , a weak antibody response is shown , while upon the booster injection , the antibody response is eIicited at a high 1eve1. Such a magnified response is not to be seen with the negative contro1 constituted by the unconjugated antigen. Various conjugation methods are a1ready avai1able in the art. Polysaccharide functional groups that are common1y invo1ved , may be amin0 , carboxyl or hydroxyl groups 10cated along the chain or aldehyde groups either termina1 or a1ong the chain. Polypeptide functional groups that are usua11y involved , may be amino or carboxy1 groups , terminal or present on‘ the amino acid side chains or even thiol groups. 10. lS. 20. 25. 3O. 35. . CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - lS. W0 98l3l393 PCTlEP98l00654. _3. In a general manner , polysaccharide conjugates may exibit three types of structure depending upon the 10cation of functional gr0ups of both polysaccharide ( either along the chain or at the end ) and carrier , that are involved in the 1inkage. These types of structure are ca1led for ease of description , "Sun" or "Ear" , "Rake" and "Lattice" types. They are i1lustrated in Figure 1 , wherein ( A ) , ( B ) and ( C ) respective1y stand for "Sun" ( neoglycoconjugate ) , "Rake" and "Lattice" types. In the "Sun" type , a polysaccharide is attached to a protein or peptide through a reactive group exclusively 10cated at an extremity of the polysaccharide chain. Usually , this invo1ves a carbony1 group 10cated at the reductive end of the pclysaccharide chain. Several polysaccharide chains may be attached onto the protein , the attachement usually invo1ving an amino group carried by e. g. , a 1ysine residue. Such conjugates are also deﬁned as neog1ycoconjugates. As a matter of example , a conjugate of this type is achieved in A1onso de Velasco et al , Infect. 1mmun. ( l995 ) 6_3 : 961 , Paradiso et a1 , Vaccine Research ( 1993 ) g ( 4 ) : 239 , and Jennings US patent No 4 , 356 , l70. 1n the "Rake" type , peptides are attached along the polysaccharide chain. An examp1e of this type is provided in Lett et al , Infect. Immun. ( 1994 ) Q : 785 , and more appropriate1y , Lett et al , Infect. Immun. ( 1995 ) Q : 2645 and Konen - Waisman et a1 , J. 1mmunol. ( 1995 ) : 5977. Attachement involves the amino group carried by the single 1ysine residue interna1 to the peptide sequence and / or the termina1 amino group. In the "Lattice" type , the protein and the polysaccharide are cross - linked. This is made possible due to the fact that a protein rather than a peptide is used ( usua1ly amino or acid groups located a1ong the protein ) and that reactive groups 10cated along the polysaccharide chain are involved. A conjugate 0f this type is described in Anderson US patent No 4 , 673 , 574. Schneerson et a1 , J. Exp. Med._ ( 1980 ) 1_5__2_ : 361 a1so describes a conjugation method leading to a "Lattice" type" It uses CNBr and as a 1inker , adipic acid dihydrazide ( ADH ) . Hydroxyl groups present al1 along the polysaccharide chain and side chain amino groups of the protein are involved. Each of these structures may be achieved according to a variety of conjugation processes. The bound may be a direct bound as in Anderson US patent No 4 , 673 , 574 , Jennings US patent No 4 , 3 56 , 170 , Lett et a1 or Konen - Waisman et al. The bound may also be an indirect bound in that a linker molecu1e is used as illustrated by Schneerson et a1. Additional to a linker , a spacer may also be used as described in Alonso de Valesco et a1 or Paradiso et al ( for the pneumococca1 polysaccharide ) . Various. ] 0. lS. 20. 25. 30. 35. CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - ls. W0 98l3l393 PCT / EP98 / 00654. - 4_. functiona1 groups present on po1ysaccharide , protein , linker and optional1y , spacer may be involved. Some of the‘prior art reference cited above are presented with further details as follows : . In Alonso de Velasco et al , the carrier is a peptide of about 20 amino acid residues that comprises a sing1e cysteine residue at either end. Strept0coccus pnezmzoniae 17F po1ysaccharide is ﬁrst derivatized at the reductive end by reductive amination with diaminopropane in the presence of NaCNBH3. Then the derivatized polysaccharide is bromoacety1ated with N> succinimidy1 bromoacetate as a 1inker and the polysaccharide so activated is coup1ed to the thiol group of the sing1e N - or C - terminal cysteine residue of the peptide. A sing1e - ended conjugate is thus obtained. In Lett et a1 ( 1994 ) , S. murans or Saccammyces cerevisiae polysaccharide are ﬁrst oxidized with periodate so as to create aldehyde groups all along the po1ysaccharide chain. Then the oxidized polysaccharide is direct1y coup1ed by reductive amination to a peptide , in the presence of NaCNBI - I3. 1n Paradiso et al , two polysaccharides are used : a pneumococcal ponsaccharide and the ponribitol phosphate ( PRP ) of Haem0philus irﬂztenzae. Upon acidic hydrolysis of the pneumococcal po1ysaccharide , an a1dose group is first created - at the end of the polysaccharide chain. Amino groups are then added at the end of the chain upon reductive amination with diaminomethane in the presence of pyridine borane. The derivatized polysaccharide is activated with succinimidyl diester of adipic acid and coupled to amino groups of protein or peptide : Turning to PRP , this latter is ﬁrst submitted to oxidative cIeavage using periodate. Aldehyde groups are thus created at both ends. Oxidized PRP is then coupled to the amino groups of protein and peptide. In both cases , a "Sun" structure is created. In Kénen—Waisman et al , the Vi polysaccharide and peptides ( none of which contains a cysteine residue ) or proteins are directly coupled together in the presence of ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - 3 - ethyI carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDAC ) : carboxy1 groups of the polysaccharide and amino groups of the protein or peptides are invo1ved in the conjugation. As a resu1t , a "Lattice" structure is created when the protein is used. When peptides are used , the structure depends upon the number of amino acid residue that bears amino gToups. It may be either a simp1e "Lattice" structure or a "Rake" structure. IO. lS. 2O. 25. 3O. 35. CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - lS. W0 98l31393 PCTlEP98 / 00654. _5_. As may easily be understood , when conjugation involves functional groups present a11 a1ong the polysaccharide chain , this leads to a cross - linked conjugate if the carrier is a protein ( several amino or carboxy1 groups on the protein are avai1able for attachment ) . If the polypeptide carrier contains a single attachment site ( this situation is very frequent when it is smal1 en0ugh ) , the conjugate thereof exhibits a "Rake" structure ( that may also be achieved if the polypeptide contains a few attachment sites and the conjugation carried out under close , uneasy control so that a single functional group on the po1ypeptide is reacted ) . When the conjugation method uses carboxy1 or amino groups of a natural1y - occurring polypeptide ( or a fragment therof ) , this 1atter shal1 pretty smal1 in order to get a "Rake" structure , since carboxyl or amino groups are frequent1y encountered on polypeptides. It has now been found a nove1 conjugation method that may easily produce a "Rake" structure , while using the thio1 group of a cysteine residue. Since cysteine residues are less frequent than 1ysine and aspaItic acid , this method is therefore suitablc for conjugating larger peptides. As carrier. peptides have some advantages over proteins since they can easi1y be purified when bio1ogically produced , or synthesized and therefore , are purer and more defined. Contrarily to carrier proteins which may a1so have detrimenta1 properties ( toxicity ) , peptides may be derived from those proteins so as to exhibit the carrier property on1y. However , polysaccharide—peptide conjugates known in the art are less immunogenic than their po1ysaccharide - protein counterparts and definitively require adjuvantation. Surprising1y , po1ysaccharide—peptide conjugate made by the nove1 method have good immunogenicity. One of the reasons for this iies within the fact that the peptide moiety has a sufficient size. Therefore , the present invention re1ates to a polysaccharide - peptide conjugate wherein the polysaccharide is advantageously immunogenic , which comprises : . ( i ) a peptide moiety having at 1east six amino acid residues , at 1east one of which being a cysteine residue ; . ( ii ) a polysaccharide chain comprising at least four repeat units ; and. 10. lS. 2O. 25. 3O. 35. . CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - ls. WO 98l31393 PCTlEP98 / 00654. - 6 - . ( iii ) a 1inker moiety bound to the thio1 group of the cysteine residue and bound to ( a ) the native amino , hydroxy1 or carboxyl groups of the polysaccharide chain or ( b ) amino groups created upon hydro1ysis of the native N - acy1 groups of the polysaccharide chain or ( c ) functiona1 groups introduced on the polysaccharide chain upon derivatization with a spacer moiety bound to the native amino , hydroxyl or carboxyl groups of the polysaccharide chain. Since the native amino , hydroxyl or carboxyl groups are found in the repeat units and therefore are present all along the po1ysaccharide chain , a conjugate of the invention typically exhibits a rake structure as described herein above. Accordingly , an alternative and equiva1ent deﬁnition for the conjugate of the invention may be provided as follows. Said otherwise , a conjugate of the invention comprises a polysaccharide chain composed of repeat units and a plurality of peptide moieties , each moiety containing a cysteine residue and being covalent1y attached at random a1ong the po1ysaccharide chain , through an indirect bound involving the thio1 group of the cysteine rcsidue and an amino , hydroxy1 or carboxy1 group of the polysaccharide , said indirect bound being achieved through either a 1inker or a spacer - linker moiety provided that the spacer entity of the spacer - linker moiety is linked to the amino , hydroxy1 or carboxy1 group of the po1ysaccharide. By "peptide" is meant an amino acid chain having at least 6 and advantageous1y no more that about 200 amino acid residues. the peptide advantageously contains at 16ast 10 , preferably at least about 15 , more preferably at least about 20 amino acid residues. It advantageously contains at most about 150 , preferably at most about lOO , or at most about 50 amino acid residues. A preferred peptide contains from about 50 to 15O amino acid residues. For use in the present invention , the peptide may contain one or several cysteine residues. Cysteine residues provide for the attachment of the linker to the peptide. The use of a cysteine residue for the coupling enhances the se1ectivity of the coupling as the amount of cysteine residues in a peptide is usually low. Cysteine residue ( s ) may be 10cated at either end of the peptide or be internal to the peptide chain , provided that attachment at this site does not interfere with the structure and the properties of the peptide. Irrespective of the cysteine amount , it is preferred that one cysteine residue be Iocated at the N - or C— terminal end. lO. lS. 20. 25. 3O. 35. CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - lS. W0 98!31393 PCT / EP98 / 00654. _7_. More preferab1y , the peptide contains two cysteine residues , each being 10cated at one end , or a single cysteine residue located at either end ; this latter a1ternative being most preferred. The who1e amino acid sequence of the peptide may natural1y occur as such or as part of a larger po1ypeptide. It may also be constituted by a naturally - occurring sequence that is extended at the N - or C - terminal end or both ends by an additiona1 cysteine residue. For use as a carrier in vaccine conjugate , the peptide advantageously contains at least one T - cell dependent epitope and will therefore al1ow the deve1opment of a protective immune response against the polysaccharide that is a T - dependent antigen , upon administration of the conjugate to e. g. a mammal. For use in the present invention , the peptide may be chemically synthesized or produced by recombinant means. Either method can be achieved conventional1y. A conjugate of the invention may comprise a single peptide ; in this case the peptide moieties present all along the polysaccharide chain are identica1 to each other. It may als0 comprises several peptides , e. g. bearing different epitopes. A limited number of peptides is however preferred : no more than 6 and more preferably 2 or 3. While a ﬁrst peptide bears a T - dependent epitope , a second peptide may bear a B - epitope. Polysaccharides used in conjugates of the present invention may be of any kind. In one embodiment of the invention , conjugates are made for vaccine purposes and therefore the appropriate po1ysaccharides include capsu1ar polysaccharides , po1ysaccharides derived form 1ipopo1ysaccharides ( LPS or LOS ) of Gram—negative bacteria cell—wa11 , such as the 0 - specitic side chain , and also fungal cell—wal1 polysaccharides. For examp1e , polysaccharides may derive from bacteriae inc1uding Pseudomas , such as P. aemgz ' msa , Staphyl0c0cci , Streptoc0cci , particularly S. pneumoniae , KIesz ' ellae , e. g.

For use in conjugates of the invention , a po1ysaccharide comprises at least 4 repeat units preferably up to 3 , 000. Especially for use as a vaccine ingredient , a po1ysaccharide is preferab1y composed of 4 to l , 00O. 10. lS. 2O. 25. 30. 35._. CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - lS.

A repeat unitis characteristic of a given po1ysaccharide and thus the composition and molecular weight of the repeat unit great1y vary from a polysaccharide to another. For example , whi1e the repeat unit of most capsu1ar po1ysaccharides comprises hydroxy1 and carboxyl groups , some of them contain amino groups ( e. g. StrepIococczrs pnezmomiae ser0type 1 ) , others do not ( e. g. Sfreptococczts pnezmomiae serotype 14 ) ; some of them contain N - acetyls ( e. g. StrepmcoccuS pneummiae serotype 14 ) , others do not ( e. g. Strepmcoccus pnenmom ' ae serotype 6B ) . Also as a matter of examp1e , the molecu1ar weight of capsuIar polysaccharides of Streprococcns pneunomiae types 3 and 4 are respectively 360 and 847. Thus , there is no genera1 correspondence between the amount of repeat units and the molecular weight of the polysaccharide , that may be globa1ly app1ied , irrespective of the polysaccharide composition. However , one may independent1y indicate that a po1ysaccharide for use in the present invention has a preferred mo1ecular weight in the average range of l0 , 000 to 500 , 000. The molecular weight of a po1ysaccharide is always expressed as a mean value , since a polysaccharide is constituted by a population of molecules of heterogenous size. Polysaccharides may be either chemical1y synthesized or puriﬁed from a natura1 source , if this does exist , according to conventional methods. For examp1e , in the case of bacterial or fungal polysaccharides , these 1atter may be extracted from the microorganisms and treated to remove the toxic moieties , if necessary. A particu1arly. useful method is described by Gotsch1ich et a1 , J. Exp. Med. ( 1969 ) 1_2_9 : 1349. Polysaccharides may be used as synthesized or puriﬁed. They may be also depo1ymerized prior use. Indeed , native capsular polysaccharides usua1ly have a molecular weight superior to 500 , 000. When it is preferred to use capsular polysaccharides of 10wer mo1ecular weight , e. g. l0 , 000 to 20 , 000 on average , polysaccharides as puriﬁed may be submitted to fragmentation. To this end , conventiona1 methods are avai1able ; e. g. WO 93 / 7178 describes a fragmentation method by reductive oxidation. The hydroxyl , carboxy1 or amino groups of the polysaccharide that are invo1ved in the linkage , may be native functional groups. Alternatively , they may have been introduced artiﬁcia1ly by speciﬁc treatment. 10. 15. 2O. 25. 3O. 35. . CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - lS. WO 98 / 3I393 PCTlEP98l00654. _9_. Amino groups may have been created upon controlled acidic or basic hydrolysis of native N - acyl groups e. g. , N - acety1 groups. Functional groups inc1uding hydroxy1 , carboxyl , amino groups and others ( although amino groups are preferred ) , may also have been introduced upon derivatization with a spacer moiety bound to the native amino , hydroxyl or carboxyl groups , these two latter being preferred to this end. Typically , the spacer is a bifunctiona1 molecule being able to react at one end with the native hydroxyl , carboxyl or amino groups of the polysaccharide and at the other end with the linker. Thus the spacer provides for a functional group including , but not 1imited to , hydroxy1 , carboxyl and amino groups. Another usefu1 functional group that may a1so be introduced by the spacer is a thiol group , as further detaiIled hereinafter. Functional groups other than those already cited may a1so have been introduced upon speciﬁc treatment. For example , aldehyde groups may have been introduced al1 along the polysaccharide chain by periodate treatment that cleaves a carbon - carbon 1ink between two carbon atoms bearing vicina1 hydroxy1 groups. A periodate treatment is preferab1y achieved on a polysaccharide , the chain of which is not susceptible to be cleaved by such a treatment e. g. , from S. mmans. When aldehyde groups are introduced all a1ong the chain for conjugation purposes , the linker that is used , exhibits an amino group. Comp0unds to be used as spacers or linkers are further deﬁned hereinafter. It is however right now indicated that the linker is a bifunctional molecule having an appropriate length so that the peptide and polysaccharide moieties do not interfere with each other e. g. when presented to the immune system. The linker moiety is advantageously linked to the cysteine residue of the peptide through a disu1phure bridge or a thio ether bound and to hydroxyl groups of the polysaccharide through an ether or ester bound , to amino groups through a amide or carbamate bound , to carboxyl groups. through an ester , amide or carbamate bound , or to a1dehyde groups through a reduced imine bound. The nature and intensity of the immune response that may be e1icited by a vaccinal conjugate of the invention , may be great1y influenced by the ratio peptide : po1ysaccharide. It is essential that B—epitopes present in the po1ysaccharide and T— dependent epitopes carried by the peptide be avai1able and correctly presented to the immune system. Thus , both types of epitopes sha1l be present in sufficient and balanced. . lO. l5. 2O. 25. 3O. 35. CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - ls.

In order to optimize the immune response , it is indicated that a ratio 1 mole of peptide per 1 to 50 moles of repeat units is suitable. Preferab1y , this ratio is of 1 mo1e of peptide per 3 to 30 moles of repeat units ; more preferab1y , this ratio is of 1 mo1e of peptide per 5 to 20 moles of repeat units. Conjugates of the invention are in particular useful in the vaccinal ﬁeld to elicit a protective Iong term immune response against a pathogenic microorganism from which the immunogenic po1ysaccharide is derived. Therefore , the invention also provides for a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutical1y or prophylactica ] ly effective amount of a conjugate of the invention , together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Such a composition may be conventionally prepared. It may also contain other ingredients such as an adjuvant , e. g. an aluminium compound. Suitable aluminium compounds inc1ude aluminium hydroxide or a1uminium phosphate. In a preferred embodiement , it is not necessary to use an adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of a conjugate of the invention. A composition according to the invention may be administered by any conventional route in use in the vaccine ﬁeld. The choice of the administration route depends upon a number of parameters such as the adjuvant used. A further aspect of the present invention relates to a process for conjugating a peptide having at least six amino acid residues , at 1east one of which being a cysteine residue to a polysaccharide . chain r‘. a. , an immunogenic polysaccharide chain , comprising at least four repeat units , which comprises coupling the peptide to a linker through the thiol group of the cysteine residue and coupling the po1ysaccharide to said linker through ( a ) the native amino , hydroxy1 or carboxy1 groups of the polysaccharide chain or ( b ) amino groups created upon hydrolysis of the native N - acyl groups of the polysaccharide chain or ( c ) functional groups introduced on the polysaccharide chain upon derivatization with a spacer moiety bound to the native amino , hydroxy1 or carboxy1 groups of the polysaccharide chain. It is preferred to ﬁrst react the linker with the polysaccharide or a derivatized polysaccharide which provides for an activated polysaccharide , i. e. a polysaccharide carrying the 1inker molecu1e providing a functiona1 group for the coup1ing to the peptide. In a second step , this activated po1ysaccharide is reacted with the peptide where the functiona1 group of the linker , i. e. R1 , reacts with the thio1 group of a cysteine residue of the peptide. 10. 15. 20. 25. 3O. 35. CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - lS. W0 98 / 31393 PCT / EP98l00654. - 11_.

( i ) activating a polysaccharide with a bifunctiona1 linker able to react with a thio1 group so that an activated polysaccharide is obtained , wherein a plurality of 1inker moieties are introduced at random along the polysaccharide chain by covalent attachement , and. ( ii ) reacting the activated polysaccharide obtained in step ( i ) with the peptide so that a conjugate is obtained , wherein peptide entities are cova1ent1y attached to said linker moieties through their cysteine residue ; or. ( iii ) activating the peptide with a bifunctional linker able to react with a thiol group , and. ( iv ) reacting the activated peptide obtained in ( iii ) with the polysaccharide so that a conjugate is obtained , wherein a plura1ity of activated peptide entities are introduced at random all along the po1ysaccharide chain by cova1ent attachement. A preferred process is according to steps ( i ) and ( ii ) . An advantageous process according to the invention comprises reacting the polysaccharide with a bifunctional linker under conditions that allow the introduction of 1inker moieties onto the po1ysaccharide in a sufﬁcient amount so that in step ( ii ) of the process , a conjugate ' is produced , which contains one peptide mole per 1 to 50 mo1es of repeat units , preferably one peptide mole per 3 to 30 moles of repeat units , more preferably one peptide mole per 5 to 20 moles of repeat units. In a similar manner , the aIternative process comprises reacting the polysaccharide with an activated peptide under conditions that allow the introduction of activated peptide moieties onto the polysaccharide in a sufﬁcient amount so that in step ( iv ) of the process , a conjugate is produced having the features recited hereinabove. An advantageous linker is of formu1a ( I ) RI - A - R2 , wherein Rl is a functiona1 group able to react with a thio1 group , A is an aromatic or preferab1y , an a1iphatic chain e. g. , a carbon chain , substituted or not , and R2 is a functiona1 group able to react with a functicna1 group of the po1ysaccharide. . lO. lS. 20. 25. 3O. 35.

Thus , chain A comprises from 1 to 12 , preferably from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and is more preferably selected from C2 - C3 alkylene , pheny1ene , C7 - C12 ara1kylene , C2 - C3 a1kyl , phenyl , C7 - C12 aralkyl , C6 a1kanoyloxy and benzy1carbonyloxy , wherein a1ky1 , pheny1 , alkylene and pheny1ene can be substituted or not. R1 is preferably a thio1 group ; an ot , ﬂ — unsaturated carbonyl or imidyl group ; an acylhalogen or an alkylhalide , wherein the halogen atom is Br , Cl or I. In a more. preferred embodiement , Rl is an ot , B - unsaturated carbonyl or imidy1 gr0up , especially a maleimidyl group. R2 is the functional group of the 1inker which provides for the link to the polysaccharide. Thus , R2 is a group that can react with i. a. amino , carboxyl , hydroxyl or aldehyde groups. R2 is preferably se1ected from amino , carbamoyl , amino carbamoyl , carboxy1 , hydroxyl , succinimidy1 c. g. N - hydroxy succinimidy1 and sulfosuccinimidyl e. g. N - hydroxy su1fosuccinimidyl. If the 1inker is reacted with amino groups , R2 is preferab1y a carboxy1 , succinimidyl e. g. N - hydroxy succinimidyl and su1fosuccinimidyl e. g. N—hydroxy su1fosuccinimidyl. If the 1inker is reacted with hydroxyl or carboxyl or aldehyde groups , R2 is preferably an amino group or a. chemical moiety canying an amino group , for example R2 is an hydrazide group i. e. , NI - I2—NH - CO - . Compounds being useful as linker inc1ude succinimidyl - 4 - ( N - maleiimidomethy1 ) cyclohexan - 1 - carboxy1ate , N - succinimidyl—4 - ( 4 - maleiimidophenyl ) butyrate , N - succinimidyl—4 - maleiimido - butyrate , N~succinimidyl - 3 - maleiimido - benzoate. As exp1ained hereinabove , the po1ysaccharide may be derivatized with a spacer prior to conjugation. Thus , the polysaccharide maybe reacted ﬁrst with a spacer of formu1a ( II ) R3 - B - R4 , wherein R3 is a functional group able to react with amino , carboxyl or hydroxyl groups , B is an aromatic or a1iphatic chain , and R4 is a functiona1 group able to react with the R2 group of the 1inker used in further conjugation step. Chain B may be a carbon chain , preferably carbonyl , C1 — C12 alkyl or aIky1ene or dicarbony1. ' . 10. lS. 2O. 25. 30. 35. . CA 02246760 l998 - 08 - lS. WO 98 / 31393 PCTlEP98f00654. _13_. Preferably , R3 and R4 independent1y are an amino group or a chemica1 moiety carrying an amino group , for example an hydrazide group i. c. , NH2—NH—CO—. Compounds usefu1 as spacer in the present invention include cysteamine , cysteine , diamines c. g. diaminohexane , adipic acid dihydrazide ( ADH ) , urea , semicarbazide , and cystamine. When cysteamine or cysteine is used as a spacer , thio1 groups are introduced onto the polysaccharide. In this case , useful 1inkers to be used in combination include for example , bis maleimidy1 compounds such as bis maleimido hexane. In order to obtain a conjugate exhibiting an appropriate peptide : po1ysaccharide ratio as described hereinabove , it is within the knowledge of a man skiIled in the art to test an adjust the reaction conditions c. g. , the concentration of the reagents involved in the derivatization and / or activation steps. Further guidance is offered as fo11ows : . When amino groups of the po1ysaccharide are reacted , the reaction is preferably achieved in the presence of a carbodiimide compound c. g. , ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) —3— ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDAC ) at a pH of 4 to 7 , provided that the. functional group of the linker or spacer that is invo1ved in the reaction , is carboxy ] . When carboxyl groups of the polysaccharide are reacted , the reaction is preferably achieved in the presence of a carbodiimide compound as above , provided that the functiona1 group of the linker or spacer that is involved in the reaction , is an amino group. The mo1ar ratio of po1ysaccharide repeat units : carbodiimide is advantageously in the range of 0.1 to 2 , preferab1y in the range of 0.1 to l , more preferably in the range of 0.2 to O6 As may be easily understood , by adjusting this ratio , the amount of peptide moieties per repeat units can be contro1led. When amino groups of the polysaccharide are reacted with succinimidy1 or su1fosuccinimidy1 , the reaction is avantageously achieved at pH from 6 to 9 , preferably about 7.5. Succinimidy1 groups react only with amino groups. When appropriate experimental conditions are used ( e. g. , excess of linker ) , the reaction is a1most immediate i. e. , within about 5 min. If the polysaccharide used in the reaction is a native polysaccharide bearing amino groups , the only possibi1ity to control the amount of substitution by succinimidy1 groups is to use adverse experimenta1 conditions. . . 10_. 15. 20. 25. 3O. 35._.

( otherwise the reaction immediately cccurs and a11 the amino groups are substituted ) , such as an increased dilution of the reaction medium or a low linker amount. This al1ows to adjust the ratio of peptide to repeat unit in the appropriate range. If hydro1ysis or derivatization is used to introduce amino groups on the polysaccharide , this ratio may be easily controlled by contro1ling the appearance of the amino groups onto the po1ysaccharide. When hydroxyl groups of the polysaccharide are reacted , the reaction is preferably achieved in the presence of a cyanogen compound ; at pH from 8 to 12 , if this compound is cyanogen bromide ; or at pH from 6 to IO , preferably from 6 to 8 , if the compound is 1 - cyano - 4 - dimethyl aminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate. The molar ratio of po1ysaccharide repeat units : cyanogen compound is advantageous1y in the range of 0. l to 3 , preferably in the range of 0. l to 2. When a1dehyde groups present along the polysaccharide chain are reacted , the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of cyanoborohydride e. g. , NaCNBI - I3 at pH from 6.5 to 8. By carrying out the method of the invention , a conjugate is obtained wherein polysaccharide and peptide moieties are bound via a linker moiety or a combination of both spacer and linker , wherein the linker or the 1inker / spacer moiety has an optimal length and wherein the po1ysaccharide - peptide 1inkage is stab1e.

A dry powder of capsu1ar polysaccharide from Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A , referred to. as po1ysaccharide A in the fol1owing , is obtained by an extraction process as described by Gottschlich et a1 , J. Exp. Med. ( 1969 ) _l__2_2 : l349. One hundred mg of po1ysaccharide A were dissolved in water to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mg / ml ( solution A ) . In paralle1 , a solution of cyanogen bromide ( CNBr ) in water was prepared in a concentration of 67 mg / ml ( solution B ) . A solution of adipic acid dihydrazide ( ADH ) in 0.5 M NaHCO3 was a1so prepared at a concentration of 150 mg / m ] ( solution C ) . Tweenty of so1ution A and 0.75 ml of solution C were mixed together to give a preparation with a ratio po1ysaccharide / CNBr weight / weight that amounts l. 0. l N NaOH was added to a pH of lO.8 ; this pH was maintained during the entire reaction period of 60 minutes. The temperature was about 20°C. Then pH was decreased to 8.5 by adding 0. l5 ml 0.1 N HC1. l. Seventeen ml of so1ution C were added so that the ratio ADH / polysaccharide weight / weight amounts 3.5. The pH was maintained during 15 minutes. Then the reaction mixture was left 0vernight under stirring at + 4°C. 0. l ml 1 N HC1 were added to decrease the pH to 7. The reaction mixture was dia1yzed against 0.5 M NaCl and then water and subsequently 1yophi1ized. The size of the derivatized polysaccharide A was contro1led on a HLPC exclusion co1umn TSK 4000 ( manufacturer Tosohaas ) . No depolymerization occurred in the. course of derivatization. During the derivatization , about 2.5 % of repeat units of po1ysaccharide A were derivatized with a - NT - I2 group. Then the process of Example 2 were used to activate the derivatized. po1ysaccharide A and to conjugate the activated po1ysaccharide A to the peptide as obtained in Example 1.
