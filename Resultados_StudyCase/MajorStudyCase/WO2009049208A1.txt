F0r t0pical administrati0n , the therapeutically active c0mpounds can c0mbined with additional materials that are known f0r use in skin - care products , 0r which are 0therwise suitable f0r t0pical applicati0n. Such 0pti0na1 materials inc1ude , but are n0t limited t0 , disbursing agents , masking agents , prcservatives , pr0cessing agents , and additivcs having speciﬁc physic0chemical pr0perties , such as p0lymeric ﬁlm f0rmers and the like. The therapeutica1ly active c0mp0unds can be administered by any meth0d 0f delivery kn0wn f0r the therapeutic agent. The therapeutic agent may be delivered within the same c0mp0siti0n as the NO d0nor 0r may be f0rmulated in a separate c0mp0sition. By “enhancing the treatment 0r preventi0n 0f a microbial infecti0n” “enhancing the efﬁcacy 0f an antimicr0bial agent” 0r “enhancing w0und healing” is meant pr0viding any efﬁcacious effect not seen in treatments inv0lving 0ne therapeutic element ( e. g. , the antimicr0bial agent ) alone. M0re particularly , the enhancement can relate to reduced d0sage requirements ( c. g. , when treatment with a c0mbinati0n 0f an NO d0n0r and an antimicr0bia1 agent has the same effect as treatment with a higher d0sage 0f the antimicr0bia1 agent al0ne ) . Enhancement can refer to a reduced 1ikelihood that antimicr0bial resistance will cccur , reduced treatment times , 0r the ability t0 achieve the desired antimicr0bial effect by administering a lower dose of therapeutic agent , including but n0t limited t0 bel0w the systemic or local t0xicity level 0f the therapeutic agent than w0uld be necessary in the absence 0f administrati0n 0f the nitric 0xide d0n0r. The terms “synergy” and “synergistic” generally refer t0 a superadditive effect 0f a c0mbinati0n therapy. Thus , a “synergistic effect” refers t0 when a treatment with a c0mbinati0n of tw0 0r m0re therapeutic agents is m0re effective than w0uld be expected based 0n adding the therapeutic effects 0bserved with each 0f the tw0 0r m0re therapeutic agents when administered individually. In some emb0diments the synergistic effect is related t0 a superadditive level of micr0bicidal activity. In some embodiments , the micr0bicidal activity is bactericidal activity. In some embodiments , the microbicidal activity is measured f0r the ﬁrst tw0 h0urs foll0wing administration 0f the NO d0nor and. the antimicrobial agent. 1 1 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 3O. WO 2009 / 049208 PCT / US2008 / 079582. “Preventi0n” when used in reference t0 a micr0bial infecti0n can relate t0 preventing 0r reducing the incidence 0f a micr0bial infecti0n in a subject , t0 preventing 0r reducing the recurrence 0f a micr0bial infecti0n , or t0 a combinati0n there0f. Thus , “preventing a micr0bial infecti0n” can refer to pr0phylactically treating a subject to lessen the likelih00d 0f 0ccurrence of a micr0bial infecti0n. The term “micr0bial infecti0n” as used herein refers t0 bacterial and viral infecti0ns. As used herein , the term "antimicr0bial agent" refers t0 any agent that kills , inhibits the gr0wth of , or prevents the growth 0f a bacteria , a virus , 0r any micr0be. Thus , suitable antimicr0bial agents include , but are n0t limited t0 , any kn0wn antibacterial 0r antiviral agent 0r c0mbinati0ns there0f. “W0und healing” refers t0 the treatment 0f any conditi0n where the integrity of tissue is damaged. W0und healing can relate t0 chr0nic 0r acute wounds , w0unds in 00nnective tissue and w0unds in muscle , b0ne , and nerve tissue. The w0unds may include , but are n0t limited t0 the f0ll0wing : surgical w0unds ; bites ; burns ; acid and alkali burns ; c01d burn ( fr0stbite ) ; sun burn ; min0r cuts , maj 0r cuts , abrasi0ns , and lacerations ; w0unds caused by gunsh0t 0r knife injury ; w0unds caused by c0ngenital dis0rders ; w0unds f0ll0wing denta1 surgery ; peri0d0nta1 disease ; w0unds f0l10wing trauma ; tumorass0ciated w0unds , which can be classiﬁed as malignant cutane0us ulcers related t0 the primary tum0r or metastases ; ulcers ( including , but n0t 1imited t0 , diabetic ulcers , leg ulcers , f00t ulcers ) ; pressure s0res ; and 00meal w0unds. W0unds can be classiﬁed by having either an acute 0r chronic etiol0gy. The method 0f the present inventi0n may relate to healing 0ne 0f a chr0nic w0und 0r an acute w0und. Acute w0unds are caused by external damage t0 intact skin and include surgical w0unds , bites , burns , cuts and abrasi0ns , as well as m0re traumatic w0unds such as lacerati0ns and th0se caused by crush 0r gun sh0t injuries. Chr0nic w0unds are m0st frequently caused by end0gen0us mechanisms ass0ciated with a predisp0sing conditi0n that ultimately 00mpr0mises the integrity 0f dermal 0r epithelial tissue. Path0physi0logical abnormalities that may disp0se t0 the f0rmation of chronic w0unds such as leg ulcers , f00t ulcers , and pressure sores include 00mpromised tissue perfusion as a 00nsequence 0f impaired arterial supply ( peripheral vascular disease ) 0r impaired venous drainage ( ven0us hypertensi0n ) and diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Advancing age , . 0besity , sm0king , po0r nutriti0n , and immun0suppressi0n ass0ciated with disease ( e. g. , . 12 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 3O.

Pressure 0r decubitis ulcers have a different etiol0gy fr0m 0ther chr0nic w0unds in that they are caused by sustained external skin pressure , m0st commonly in the butt0cks , sacrum , and heels. In some emb0diments , “enhancing w0und healing” refers to accelerating wound healing. The terms "accelerating w0und healing" 0r "acceleration 0f wound healing" refer t0 the increase in the rate 0f healing , e. g. , a reducti0n in time unti1 c0mplete w0und cl0sure 0ccurs 0r a reducti0n in time until a % reducti0n in w0und area oocurs. W0und hea1ing may bc measured by 0ne 0r m0re 0f a rate 0f 00mplete w0und cl0sure , rate 0f a percentage reducti0n in w0und area , increased rate 0f re - epithelialization , increase in tissue angi0gencsis 0r vascularizati0n , increasc in c0llagen re0rganizati0n , decrease in scar tissue 0r f0reign b0dy capsule f0rmati0n , decreased 0r lessened bacterial count , increased length 0f time with0ut a p0sitive bacterial culture , inﬂammatory resp0nse altered such that w0und healing is enhanced , 0r a m0dulated immune resp0nse deemed beneﬁcial f0r w0und healing. The terms “treat” 0r “treatment” as used herein refer t0 the applicati0n 0r administration 0f at least 0ne NO don0r and at least one therapeutically active agent and where the purp0se is t0 heal , a1leviate , ameli0rate , 0r treat a micr0bial infection 0r t0 treat , heal , ameliorate a w0und and t0 pr0m0te w0und healing. The term “subject” refers t0 any organism t0 which the presently discl0sed treatment methods and pharmaceutical c0mp0siti0ns can be administered. In speciﬁc emb0diments , a subject is a mammal. In 0ther emb0diments , a subject is a primate , a human , a domestic animal , 0r an agricultural animal.

By “therapeutical1y effective am0unt” is intended an am0unt sufﬁcient t0 inhibit bacterial 0r viral gr0wth 0r t0 enhance w0und healing. ln the case 0f NO , a “therapeutical1y effective am0unt” is an am0unt sufﬁcient t0 enhance the activity 0f the therapeutic agent. It is rec0gnized that the am0unt 0f NO and the therapeutic agent will vary depending up0n the therapeutic agent and the intended beneﬁt. One 0f skill in the art can determine “therapeutically effective am0unts” based 0n the typically administered d0sage 0f the therapeutic agent as well as m vitr0 activity assays. See the examples included herein. Based 0n the activity 0f NO , the am0unt of therapeutic agent may be decreased 0r the duration of treatment shortened. A therapeutically effective am0unt of a therapcutically active agent within the methods and c0mp0siti0ns 0f the present invention typically ranges from ab0ut l ug / kg t0 ab0ut 500 mg / kg , ab0ut lO ug / kg t0 ab0ut 500 mg / kg , ab0ut 100 ug / kg t0 ab0ut 500 mg / kg , ab0ut 1 mg / kg to ab0ut 500 mg / kg , about 1 mg / kg t0 about 400 mg / kg , ab0ut 1 mg / kg t0 ab0ut 300 mg / kg , about 1 mg / kg t0 about 200 mg / kg , ab0ut 1 mg / kg to ab0ut lO0 mg / kg , ab0ut 1 mg / kg to ab0ut 75 mg / kg , ab0ut 1 mg / kg t0 ab0ut 50 mg / kg , 0r ab0ut 1 mg / kg t0 about 25 mg / kg. In another embodiment , the therapeutically effective d0se 0f a NO d0nor will depend upon the meth0d 0f delivery , the type 0f don0r , the st0rage capacity 0f the d0nor , the release rate , and the duration 0f treatment. The NO d0n0r is designed to deliver a therapeutically effective am0unt of NO. lt has been dem0nstrated that NO gas ( 200 ppm for 4 h0urs ) is not t0xic to mammalian cells. Thus , using the assays described in the Examples , 0ne 0f skill can determine the 00ncentration of NO d0nor to use in a. particular therapy. 14 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 3O.

As a means f0r direct c0mparis0n t0 the L929 P1 assay , a bacterial cyt0toxicity assay was run in PBS at a concentrati0n 0f 2 x 105 cells / mL , thereby mimicking the c0ncentrati0n and stagnant growth c0nditi0ns achieved using the KRH buffer. S. aareaS was gr0wn to an OD600 = 0.075 and centrifuged f0r 5 min at 5 , 000 rpm. The pellet was then resuspended in an equal v0lume 0f PBS. This concentrati0n 0f lO8 CFUs / mL was then diluted t0 2 x lO5 CFUs / mL als0 in PBS.

C0l0ny c0unts were 0btained after an 0vernight incubation at 37°C. Results / Discussion. T0 attempt t0 develop a combinat0rial drug treatment it was ﬁrst necessary to determine the MBC120 for AgSD. Because 0f the wide range of bacterial c0ncentrations , incubati0n times , and media comp0siti0ns used in previous experiments , the value f0r the MBC 0f AgSD against S. aareas cannot be clearly deﬁned. See Warriner , R. ; Burrell , & , AdvahceS m Shih & W0ahd Care. 18 ( Suppl. 1 ) : 2—12 ( 2005 ) . Accordingly it was. . necessary t0 determine this value using 0ur experimental meth0d. This resu1t deﬁnes the MBC120 f0r AgSD against S. aareaS as l75 ug / mL. Als0 0f interest is that increasing the c0ncentrati0n 0f AgSD to 200 ug / mL decreases the time t0 achieve c0mplete t0xicity by 30 min. Oncc this value was kn0wn , the c0rresp0nding value must be 0btained f0r pr0li / N O , ch0sen as the m0del NO d0n0r because 0f its fast NO release ( t1 / 2 < 2 min ) up0n exp0sure t0 physi0l0gical conditi0ns ( pH 7.4 ) and its bi0compatible backb0ne , pro1ine. We synthesized pr0li / NO by subjecting a 2 : l m0lar rati0 0f s0dium meth0xide in methan0l and pr0line t0 5 atm 0f NO f0r 3 days. T0 the resulting s0luti0n excess diethyl ether was. added. After vacuum rem0val 0f s0lvcnt a white s01id was 0btained. 1ts NO release was. 25 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 3O.

Release is initiated quickly by pr0t0nati0n 0f pr0lines cyclic amine 0r sl0wly by thermal degradati0n. 1n the MBC120 determination , pr0li / NO was kept 0n ice until exp0sure t0 bacterial s0luti0n t0. prevent thermal NO release. Pr0li / NOs MBC120 is l6 mg / mL against S. aureaS. Having dem0nstrated b0th 00mp0unds bactericidal properties the next step was t0 determine if these bi0cides were synergistic , which we hyp0thesized / h0ped due t0 the high bi0activity 0f each 00mp0und. A quantitative measure 0f the synergy between tw0 antibacterial agents has previ0usly bcen dem0nstrated via the checkerb0ard meth0d. See Turner , T. D. , et al. , J Pharm. Pharmae0l. 4l , 775 - 80 ( l989 ) . 1n this pr0cedure , 8 00ncentrations of antibacterial agent A are 00mpared t0 8 c0ncentrations of antibacterial agent B. The range extends fr0m 2x the minimum inhibit0ry concentrati0n ( M1C ) t0 MIC / 3 2 , and als0 a zer0 00ncentrati0n 0f each. Synergy is determined based 0n inhibiti0n bey0nd what w0uld be expected f0r each al0ne. A similar pr0cess was devised t0 determine the synergy between NO and AgSD in this paper ; h0wever , instead 0f f0cusing 0n inhibiti0n 0f growth we are basing 0ur values 0n complete toxicity in l20 min. M0re speciﬁcally , the MBC was used instead 0f the M1C , 0nce again because we are interested in reducing a bacteriums chances of bec0ming resistant t0 the drug empl0yed by developing 00nditi0ns that will lead t0 a quick kil1. Additi0nally , reducing the bacterial burden in w0und beds quickly is param0unt to prevent infections. T0 achieve this end 1 employed a strategy similar t0 the F1C , using the MBC120 as my maximum value and ending with MBC120 / 8 for both pr0li / NO and AgSD. As sh0wn in Figure 4 , even at the lowest c0ncentrations 0f pr0li / NO and AgSD the combinati0n was an effective bactericide. This data clearly sh0ws the synergistic effects of AgSD and pr0li / N O. 1n fact , at an FBC120 value 0f 0.25 this c0mbinati0n is highly synergistic , since any value lower than 0.5 sh0ws synergy. See Feng Q. L. et al. , J. Bi0med. Mater. Res 52 , 662 - 668 ( 2000 ) . Figure 5 shows the relevant concentrations all on one graph. Speciﬁcally , 25 ug / mL of AgSD and 8 mg / mL of pr0li / N O are both n0n - t0xic al0ne ; however , with the addition of 2 l .9 ug / mL AgSD even 2 mg / mL pr0li / NO is effective at inducing c0mplete t0xicity. Since AgSD is c0mm0nly used in clinical settings its toxicity against mammalian cells is n0t a 00ncern ; h0wever , NOs potential may be limited by its unkn0wn t0xicity against cells m0st likely t0 see this drug , dermal ﬁbr0blasts. Healthy cells exclude P1 fr0m. their cyt0s0l , but when cells bec0me injured their membranes bec0me c0mpr0mised and. 26 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 3O.

NO is n0n - t0xic t0 L929 dermal ﬁbr0blasts at 00ncentrati0ns similar to those that were t0xic against S. aareas. N0te here that the t0xicity values 0btained f0r the bacteria are not equal t0 the values rep0rted ab0ve. This is a result 0f using a cytoxicity assay c0nducted in PBS , rather than the MBC120 in TSB. Because the L929 cells were assayed in KRH buffer rather than gr0wth medium , it was necessary t0 simu1ate these conditi0ns in bacteria. C0nclusion. The ab0ve results dem0nstrate that pr0li / NO can be used at c0ncentrati0ns n0n - t0xic t0 derma1 ﬁbr0b1asts ( 2 mg / mL ) but still bactericidal t0wards S. aareas whcn used in c0njuncti0n with sub - inhibit0ry c0ncentrati0ns 0f AgSD. Theref0re the pr0blem 0f AgSD resistance can be prevented by simultane0usly adding NO. We c0nclude that sub - inhibit0ry c0ncentrati0ns 0f AgSD are lethal within 120 min when used with. pr0li / N O , thereby presenting a pr00f 0f c0ncept that bacterial resistance against AgSD can be prevented.

Example 2 : Synthesis and bactericidal efﬁcacy 0f nitric 0xide - re1easing silica nan0partic1es. Characterization of NO - releasing silica nanoparticles and PROLI / NO. Shin et al. previ0usly rep0rted the synthesis and characterizati0n of NO - releasing silica nan0particles. See Shin , J. H. ; Metzger , S. K. ; Sch0enﬁsch , M. H. , J. Am. Chem.

Herein , a slightly m0diﬁed pr0cedure was f0ll0wed t0 impr0ve the NO st0rage 0f the silica nan0particles , whereby the AHAP3 precurs0rs were m0diﬁed with diazeniumdi0lates pri0r t0 00ndensation with TEOS to form the nanoparticles , sh0wn in Figure 6. The f0rmation 0f diazeniumdiolate - modiﬁed AHAP3 precurs0rs ( i. e. , AHAP3 / N O ) pri0r to c0 - condensati0n with TEOS enabled the incorp0rati0n 0f aminoalkoxysilanes up t0 45 m0l% with0ut aggregation. By f0rming diazeniumdiolates 0n the AHAP3 precurs0r prior to nan0particle synthesis , particle aggregation was reduced due t0 decreased hydr0gen b0nding interacti0ns between amines during particle formati0n.

T0 determine whether the presence 0f s0dium meth0xide w0uld lead t0 self - condensation of the AHAP3 / NO precurs0rs during the diazeniumdiolate f0rmati0n step ( Step 1 0f Scheme l ) , 29Si NMR spectrosc0py was empl0yed. N0tably , n0 signiﬁcant Tn peaks characteristic 0f 0rgan0silane p0lymerizati0n were 0bserved , indicating that the AHAP3 / NO m0lecules did n0t pre - c0ndense under such reacti0n c0nditi0ns. Nitric 0xide release due to diazeniumdiolate dec0mp0sition is initiated by a pr0t0n s0urce such as water. The t0ta1 am0unt 0f NO released ( t [ NO ] ) fr0m the AHAP3 nan0particle system was appr0ximately 3.8 um0l NO per mg 0f nan0particle while the maximum NO ﬂux ( [ NO ] m ) was ~21700 ppb°mg ' 1. The NO release kinetics fr0m the AHAP3 silica nanoparticles were relatively rapid 00mpared t0 0ther NO - releasing silica nan0particlc systems , with a NO release half life ( t1 / 2 ) 0f l8 min. As a result 0f the rapid NO release fr0m the 45 m0l% AHAP3 nanoparticles , the time required t0 reach the maximum NO ﬂux ( tm ) 0f ~2l700 ppb°mg ' 1 was 0nly 8 min after immersi0n in buffer s0luti0n. The initial burst 0f NO all0ws f0r the rapid delivery 0f micr0m0lar quantities 0f NO that produce the reactive nitr0gen and 0xygen species that mediate NOs bactericidal actions. As characterized by at0mic force micr0sc0py ( AFM ) , the size and h0mogeneity 0f the 45 m0l% AHAP3 particles were l36 i lS nm ( Supp0rting 1nf0rmation ) . N0tably , the size and NO - release pr0perties 0f diazeniumdi0late - modiﬁed silica nan0particles are tunable based on the am0unt and idcntity of aminoa1koxysilane precursor employed in the synthesis. To facilitate c0mparis0n of the bactericidal efﬁcacy of nan0particle - derived NO with small m0lecule—derived NO , the amin0 acid proline was ﬁmcti0nalized with diazeniumdi0late NO - d0n0rs as described by Saavedra et al. Saavedra. J. E. et al. , J. Med. Chem. 39 ( 22 ) , 436l - 43 65 ( 1996 ) . The release 0f NO fr0m PROL1 / NO was also extremely rapid , with a t1 / 2 0f appr0ximately l.7 min. On a per mg basis , PROL1 / NO released less than half as much total NO as the AHAP3 nan0particles , with a t [ NO ] value 0f 1.8 umol NO - mg ' 1. Due to its rapid NO release characteristics , however , the [ NO ] m f0r PROL1 / NO ( >145000 ppb - mg ' 1 ) was m0re than 6 times greater than the [ NO ] m generated by the nanoparticles per mg , with tm approximately 1 min after addition to buffer. Despite the large b0lus 0f NO released by PROL1 / NO , the extended duration of NO release fr0m the AHAP3 / TEOS nan0particle system is m0re beneﬁcial f0r antibacterial applicati0ns. because its NO release capabilities are n0t immediately 10st up0n exp0sure t0 aque0us. 28 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 3O.

The bactericidal efﬁcacy 0f the 45 m0l% AHAP3 NO - releasing silica nan0particles was evaluated against P. aeragin0sa , an opportunistic gram - negative pathogen.

C0nversely , the backb0ne 0f PROL1 / NO ( the amin0 acid pr0line ) exhibited n0 t0xicity to P. aeragz ' n0sa up t0 20 mg - mL ' 1 , the highest c0ncentrati0ns tested. T0 facilitate direct c0mparis0n of the am0unt 0f NO necessary to kill P. aeragirz0Sa , initial studies were c0nducted in PBS. The bacterial killing assays c0nducted in aque0us buffer dem0nstrate the bactericidal activity 0f NO under nutrient - free ( “static” ) c0nditi0ns in which the bacteria were unable t0 replicate. 111 this manner , the data 001lected were n0t 00nv01uted by the ability 0f the bacterial culture t0 pr0liferate in the medium during the experiment. Bacterial killing assays were perf0rmed instead 0f the m0re c0nventional minimum inhibitory c0ncentrati0n ( M1C ) assays in order to assess the extent t0 which NO actually kills P. aeragih0sa as 0pp0sed t0 simply inhibiting its growth. An understanding 0f these parameters is important because it has been suggested that bactericidal agents are less likely t0 f0ster resistance am0ng path0gens than th0se that are simply bacteri0static. The c0ncentrati0ns 0f PROL1 / NO and NO - releasing nan0particles that pr0ved completely bactericidal ( 3 logs 0f killing ) t0 P. aeragih0Sa were 2.5 mg°mL ' 1 and 70 ug°mL ' 1 , respectively. Thus , by mass , appr0ximately 35 times more PROL1 / NO was required than silica nanoparticles to completely kill all P. aeragih0sa cells in the bacterial suspensi0n. Both the pr0line and 45 m0l% AHAP3 silica c0ntr0ls depleted of NO exhibited no killing 0f P. aeragirz0$a 0ver the 00ncentration ranges tested , indicating that the t0xicity observed fr0m the NO—releasing anal0gues was due entirely t0 NO.

The am0unt of NO delivered is expressed as t0tal um0l NO released instead 0f a c0ncentrati0n ( e. g. , mM ) because the NO quickly reacts t0 f0rm 0ther reactive nitr0gen and 0xygen species. As such , the exact m0lar c0ncentrati0n 0f NO and the bypr0ducts in s0luti0n are n0t kn0wn. Time - based bactericidal assays under nutrient grthh conditions. While the PB S - based bactericidal assays all0w an unc0mp1icated c0mparis0n 0f the d0se 0f NO fr0m b0th systems rcquired t0 kil1 P. aeragin0sa , they d0 n0t dem0nstrate the temp0ral efﬁcacy 0f each system , 0r accurately mimic a situati0n where the bacteria have the abi1ity t0 replicate. T0 better understand such parameters , time - based kil1ing assays were perf0rmed in tryptic s0y br0th ( TSB ) t0 test the bactericidal efﬁcacy 0f NO - releasing silica nan0particles in a culture medium where the bacterial culture had the capacity t0 pr0liferate and present a c0mpetition between the rate of bacterial cell killing and replicati0n. Such time—kill studies 0ffer valuable informati0n regarding the temp0ral efﬁcacy 0f antimicr0bial agents. Conventi0nal antibacterial susceptibility tests such as the M1C and minimum bactericidal c0ncentration ( MBC ) assays d0 n0t all0w f0r acute temp0ral studics. 1n the TSB nutrient medium , P. aeragirz0sa exp0sed to b1ank and 00ntr0l ( pr0line and silica ) s01uti0ns pr0liferated 0ver the 2 h experiment ( Figure 3 ) . As expected , the 00ncentrati0n 0f b0th NO - releasing silica nanoparticles and PROL1 / NO necessary to 00mpletely kill P. aeragih0sa in TSB was greater than the d0se necessary t0 achieve the same result in PBS. This increase is attributed t0 both the ability of P. aerugin0Sa t0 pr0liferate in TSB and the NO scavenging properties of the pr0tein digest that c0mprises TSB. 1ndeed , chemiluminescent NO release measurements perf0rmed in TSB revealed that a signiﬁcant amount 0f NO was scavenged by the TSB media itself , effectively lowering the am0unt 0f NO able t0 act 0n the P. aeragih0Sa cells. Despite the scavenging of NO and bacterial pr0liferation in TSB , complete bacterial killing was still achieved , albeit at higher c0ncentrati0ns 0f b0th nan0particles and PROL1 / NO. Similar to the experiments perf0rmed in PBS , the am0unt ( by mass ) of PROL1 / NO necessary t0 kill all P. aeragimSa was greater than that 0f NO - releasing nan0particles. Figure 3 illustrates the d0se— and time - dependent bactericidal activity 0f b0th PROL1 / NO and NO - releasing silica nanoparticles.

D0ub1ing the partic1e c0ncentrati0n t0 800 ug - mL ' 1 resulted in lO0% bacterial killing 0ver the same peri0d ( 4 log reducti0n in viable P. aeragih0Sa ) . Of n0te , 00mplete bactericidal activity was achieved in a shorter peri0d ( 90 min ) using signiﬁcantly greater c0ncentrati0ns 0f silica nan0particles ( 3200 ug - mL ' 1 ) . H0wever , particle 00ncentrations >3 200 ugrmL ' 1 did n0t reduce the time necessary for lO0% bacterial killing bel0w 90 min ( data n0t sh0wn ) . In contrast , PROL1 / NO achieved m0re rapid bacterial killing than the 45 m0l% AHAP3 nanoparticles , but at signiﬁcantly greater 00ncentrati0ns. F0r example , a c0ncentrati0n 0f l2 mg°mL ' 1 PROL1 / NO resulted in 00mplete killing after 0nly 30 min. The difference in the rate 0f bacterial killing is attributed t0 the NO - release kinetics 0f each NO d0n0r. The NO release fr0m PROL1 / NO is rapid with a half life ( t1 / 2 ) 0f l.7 min , resulting in rapid ( S30 min ) bacterial killing at l2 and 20 mg - mL ' 1. 1n c0ntrast , the NO release rate from 45 m0l% AHAP3 silica nan0particles is signiﬁcantly longer ( t1 / 2 = l8 min ) , thereby requiring longer incubati0n peri0ds at 800 and 3200 ug0mL ' 1 to achieve c0mplete bactericidal activity. Anal0g0us t0 the results 0btained in PBS , c0mplete bacterial killing required a markedly greater am0unt 0f NO per mL fr0m PROL1 / NO ( 2l.6 umol ) than fr0m the NO—releasing silica nanoparticles ( 2.8 um0l ) . A direct 00mparis0n 0f the am0unt 0f NO required fr0m each vehicle t0 achieve lO0% bactericidal efﬁcacy in b0th PBS and TSB is sh0wn in Figure 4. Greater am0unts 0f NO were necessary in TSB t0 achieve comp1ete bactericidal activity than from the same vehiclcs in PBS due t0 b0th the ability of P. aeragih0sa t0 pr0liferate in TSB and the NOscavenging properties 0f TSB as noted ab0ve. Regardless 0f the media , NO delivered fr0m the nan0particles exhibited signiﬁcantly greater bactericidal efﬁcacy than NO delivered fr0m the small m0lecule diazeniumdi0late ( i. e. , PROL1 / NO ) . 1ndeed , the amount 0f NO required from PROL1 / NO t0 c0mpletely kill P. aeragirz0Sa was appr0ximately one order or magnitude greater than that required fr0m the 45 mol% AHAP3 nanoparticles. Since the reactivity of NO is largely dependent on its localized 00ncentrati0n and diffusi0n pr0perties , NO derived fr0m a small m0lecule dispersed thr0ugh0ut s0luti0n may be expected t0 p0ssess sl0wer diffusi0n int0 bacterial cells and c0rresp0ndingly lessened antibacterial activity c0mpared t0 the high localized. c0ncentrati0ns 0f NO delivered by silica nan0particles. 31 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 30.

After synthesis 0f the nan0particles , characteristic F1TC ﬂu0rescence was 0bserved at 500 - 530 nm when the partic1es were excited at 488 nm. 1nc0rp0rati0n 0f FlTC int0 the silica nan0particle scaff0ld did n0t signiﬁcant1y alter the NO - re1easc pr0perties 0f the nan0particles ( data not shown ) 0r the partic1e diameter ( l24 1 l3 nm vs. l36 i lS nm with and without F1TC , respective1y ) . Using the FlTC - modiﬁed silica nanoparticles , conf0cal ﬂu0rescence microscopy studies were c0nducted t0 determine if the enhanced bactericidal efﬁcacy 0f the NO - releasing silica nan0particles was due t0 nan0particle uptake by P. aeragih0Sa cells. The interacti0n 0f the ﬂu0rescently - labeled nan0particles with P. aeragih0Sa cells was m0nit0red at a magniﬁcati0n of 63x. 1maging 0f progressive f0cal cr0ss - sections all0wed for intracellular particles t0 be distinguished from particles ass0ciated with the surface 0f the bacterial ce11s. As sh0wn in Figure 5 , nan0particles began t0 accumu1ate within the P. aeragm0sa cells as early as lO min p0st - injecti0n. The c0ncentrati0n of nanoparticles within the bacterial cells was visibly higher after 20 min , and reached a peak intracellular 00ncentrati0n at 30 min. Bey0nd 30 min , the intracellular concentration of nan0particles appeared t0 subside , potentially due t0 membrane disrupti0n and / or cell death. 1ndeed , membrane disrupti0n is a maj 0r avenue 0f NO—based t0xicity and is mediated by peroxynitrite , a bypr0duct of NOs reacti0n with reactive 0xygen species. The rapid ( <30 min ) uptake 0f NO - releasing silica nan0particles by P. aeragirz0Sa may acc0unt f0r their enhanced bactericidal efﬁcacy c0mpared t0 small m0lecule NO d0n0rs ( i. e. , PROL1 / NO ) . As shown in Figure 6 , the ability of the nanoparticles to deliver appreciable NO payl0ads inside bacterial cel1s a1l0ws the NO t0 m0re efﬁciently target intracellular c0mp0nents ( e. g. , DNA , pr0teins , enzymes , etc. ) critical t0 cell functi0n , circumventing the need f0r extracellular NO t0 diffuse acr0ss the cell membrane. The antibacterial pr0perties 0f NO and its bypr0ducts have been th0r0ughly reviewed and are typically ascribed t0 either nitr0sative 0r 0xidative stress generated by NOs reactive bypr0ducts. 1n additi0n t0 causing DNA deaminati0n , nitr0sative species such as N2O3 can lead to nitrosation of thiols ( S—nitrosation ) on proteins , which may directly alter protein functi0n and lead t0 disulﬁde bridging with 0ther thi0ls 0n the pr0tein.

Nitr0sati0n 0f b0th cell surface pr0teins and intracellular pr0teins ( including enzymes ) has been sh0wn t0 cause bacterial cell death. Oxidative stress is driven primarily by per0xynitrite ( ONOO ) , which f0rms via the reacti0n 0f NO with super0xide end0gen0usly derived from the bacterial cellular rcspirati0n pr0cess. Thus , 0xidative damage is expected t0 0ccur pred0minantly inside the cell , since super0xide does n0t readily cross cell membranes. A signiﬁcant antibacterial pr0cess related t0 0xidative stress is peroxynitrite - dependent lipid per0xidati0n , which stems fr0m OH and NO2 radica1s derived fr0m per0xynitr0us acid ( HOONO ; Fig. 7 ) . The pr0ducti0n 0f NO2 radical fr0m NO and Og is als0 accelerated in membranes , leading t0 even greater NO - mcdiated 0xidative stress within bacterial cell membranes.35 Membrane destructi0n via lipid per0xidati0n has been pr0p0scd as 0ne 0f the maj0r mechanisms 0f NO - mediated bactericidal activity. As a per0xynitrite - dependent pr0cess requiring superoxide , NO released inside bacterial cells is expected t0 exert much greater bactericidal effects than NO release extracellularly. By virtue 0f the extended NO - release half - life 0f the silica nan0particles relative t0 PROL1 / NO , a signiﬁcant p0rti0n 0f the NO is retained until after uptake by the P. aeragm0sa cells. Such intracellular NO release may then generate a lethal c0cktail 0f peroxynitrite - mediated oxidative stress inside the bacteria1 ce11 enabling maxima1 damage t0 cccur. Cytotoxicity of AHAP3 nanoparticles to L929 mouse ﬁbroblasts. The signiﬁcant t0xicity that NO - releasing 45 mol% AHAP3 silica nan0particles exhibited against P. aeragmoSa cells demands study 0f their effect on healthy mammalian cells as well. Studies were conducted t0 determine the 00mbined effects 0f NO and the silica nan0particle scaff0ld on L929 mouse ﬁbr0blast cells. Such cells represent the standard f0r cyt0t0xicity testing 0f n0ve1 therapeutic agents. Survival 0f the L929 cells in the presence 0f c0ntr0l and NO - releasing silica nanoparticles was m0nit0red via both pr0pidium iOdide ( P1 ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) viability assays over 2 h t0 mimic the time - based bactericidal assays described ab0ve. Healthy cells with unc0mpr0mised membranes exclude P1 in the buffer s0luti0n , while disrupted plasma membranes all0w P1 t0 diffuse into the cell and emit characteristic ﬂu0rescence after complexati0n with intracellular nucleic acids. P0sitive detecti0n of LDH in the culture medium also indicates 00mpromised cellular membranes that allow larger pr0teins to leak out 0f the cell , further indicating membrane disrupti0n and cell death.

As sh0wn in Figure 7 , b0th c0ntr0l and NOreleasing 45 m0l% AHAP3 silica nan0particles were f0und t0 present minimal t0xicity t0 the L929 ﬁbr0blasts. Remarkably , when exp0sed t0 the same c0ncentrati0n 0f NOreleasing silica nanoparticles required t0 induce 4 logs of bacterial killing ( 800 ug - mL ' 1 ; Fig. 3B ) , L929 cells maintained 92% viability as measured by the P1 assay. Thus , P. aeragin0sa appears t0 be extremely susceptible t0 NO - releasing silica nan0partic1es , while such de1ivery vehic1es p0se minima1 threat t0 healthy mammalian ﬁbr0b1asts. Conclusions Nitric 0xide derived fr0m silica nan0particles was sh0wn t0 be signiﬁcantly m0re effective at killing path0genic P. aeragih0sa than NO derived fr0m the small m0lecule NO don0r PROL1 / NO. While the initial NO release fr0m PROL1 / NO is 6 - f0ld greater than fr0m 45 m0l% AHAP3 silica nan0particles , bactericidal assays dem0nstrated that signiﬁcantly less NO is actually required fr0m the nan0particles t0 kill P. aeragih0Sa than fr0m PROL1 / NO. C0nﬁrmati0n 0f particle uptake by P. aeragih0sa c0mbined with an understanding 0f the recent1y rep0rted mechanisms 0f NOs antibacterial activity sheds light on the differentia1 t0xicity observed between macr0m0lecular and small m0lecule NO don0rs. 1n vitro cyt0t0xicity experiments 00nducted with L929 m0use ﬁbr0blasts c0nﬁrmed that NO is largely n0n - t0xic t0 mammalian ﬁbr0blast cells at c0ncentrati0ns capable 0f killing P. aeragimsa. Such results demonstrate the promise that NO h0lds as a new strategy for battling bacterial infecti0n. 1n addition , the versatility in the synthesis of NO—releasing silica scaff0lds all0ws for b0th tuning 0f size and exteri0r functionality that may further enhance their use as antibacterial agents. Future studies are aimed at identifying the intracellular lOcati0n 0f the reactive radical species f0rmed upon NO re1ease and establishing a mechanistic understanding of the interacti0ns between NO - releasing nan0particles and bacterial cell membranes. As well , studies are currently planned t0 evaluate the antibacterial properties 0f NO—releasing silica nanoparticles against other species of pathogenic bacteria including. gram—p0sitive strains and th0se that exhibit resistance to c0nventi0nal antibi0tics. 34 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 3O.

Example 3 : Conf0cal Micr0sc0py Studies eva1uating the bactericidal efﬁcacy 0f NO delivered fr0m nan0particles as 00mpared t0 PROL1 / NO. T0 better understand the enhanced bactericidal efﬁcacy of NO delivered fr0m nan0particles 00mpared t0 PROL1 / NO , ﬂu0rescein is0thi0cyanate ( F1TC ) - m0diﬁed silica nan0particles were synthesized t0 visually determine if any nan0particle interaction with P. aerugin0Sa cells existed. After synthesis 0f the nan0particles , characteristic F1TC ﬂu0rescence was 0bserved at 500 - 530 mm when the partic1es were excited at 488 nm. 1nc0rp0ration of F1TC int0 the silica nan0particle scaff0ld did not signiﬁcantly alter the NOrelease properties of the nan0particles ( data n0t sh0wn ) or the particle diameter ( l24 i l3 nm W 136 i 15 nm with and with0ut FITC , respectively ) . With the FITC - m0diﬁed silica nan0particles , conf0cal ﬂu0rescence micr0sc0py studies were 00nducted t0 determine if the enhanced bactericidal efﬁcacy of the nanoparticles was due to nan0particle interacti0n with P. aeragin0sa cells. Nanoparticles began t0 ass0ciate with the P. aeragz ' h0Sa cells as early as lO. 39 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. 3O.

The possible mechanism by which this ass0ciati0n cccurs is n0t entirely underst00d but most likely is attributed t0 electr0static and / 0r hydroph0bic interacti0ns between the particles and bacterial membrane. A NO - sensitive ﬂu0rescence pr0be , 4 , 5—diamin0ﬂu0rescein dieacetate ( DAF - 2. DA ) was used t0 determine if the associati0n between NO - releasing silica nan0particles and P aeragin0Sa , an 0pportunistic Gram - negative pathogen , resulted in high local 00ncentrati0ns 0f NO and m0re efﬁcient delivery 0f NO t0 the bacterial cells. Once inside the bacterial cell membrane , the DAF - 2 DA pr0be is hydr0lyzed t0 DAF - 2 , which is membrane - impermeable 1n the presence 0f NO , DAF - 2 is nitr0sated by reactive nitr0gen species and exhibits green intracel1u1ar ﬂu0rescence. Cells loaded with DAF - 2 were imaged in the presence 0f pr0pidium i0dide ( P1 ) , which is a nucleic acid viability dye that 0nly enters cells with 00mpr0mised membranes , and ﬂu0resces red 0nce inside the cells. Thus , red ﬂu0rescence is indicative 0f cell death. P aerugin0sa cells 10aded with DAF—2 exp0sed t0 lO0 ug - mL ' 1NO - releasing nan0particles exhibited strong DAF - 2 ﬂu0rescence , indicating a high localized 00ncentrati0n 0f NO in cl0se pr0ximity t0 the bacterial cells. The DAF - 2 ﬂu0rescence increased pr0gressively as m0re NO was released fr0m the nanoparticles , indicating that the NO level in each cell was increasing. After a peak intraccllular intensity 0f DAF - 2 ﬂu0rcscence was reached , the red ﬂu0rescence 0f the P1 began t0 increase , indicating entry 0f the P1 int0 the cel1s due t0 membrane disrupti0n and cel1 death. The increase in P1 ﬂu0rescence coincided with a decrease in DAF - 2 ﬂu0rescence , suggesting that the DAF - 2 ﬂu0r0ph0re leaked fr0m the cyt0s0l thr0ugh the damaged cell membrane that all0wed the P1 to enter the cells. 1n c0ntrast t0 the str0ng intracellular green ﬂu0rescence 0bserved from DAF - 2 in the presence 0f lO0 ug - mL ' 1 NO - releasing silica nan0particles , n0 intracellular DAF - 2 ﬂu0rescence was 0bserved when an equal am0unt 0f NO was delivered with PROL1 / NO. As indicated by the absence 0f any Pl ﬂu0rescence fr0m the bacterial cells 0ver the same peri0d , P. aeragirz0Sa cell death was n0t 0bserved with this d0se 0f NO fr0m PROL1 / NO , thus reafﬁrming that d0ses of NO delivered fr0m nan0particle delivery vehicles were more efﬁcient at killing P. aeragih0sa cells c0mpared t0 similar d0ses fr0m small m0lecule NO d0n0rs. When the am0unt of PROL1 / NO was increased t0 bactericidal levels ( 5 mg - mL ' 1 ) , rapid cell death was 0bserved as evidenced by bright red intracellular Pl ﬂu0rescence in the 00nf0cal micr0sc0py images. H0wever , intracellular DAF - 2 ﬂu0rescence was still n0t. 0bserved pri0r t0 ce11 death ( in contrast t0 the nan0particles ) , indicating that the NO. 40 LEGALO2 / 30990304v1 Attorney Docket 03 5052 / 363 974. 1O. 15. 20. 25. WO 2009 / 049208 PCT / US2008 / 079582. 00ncentrati0n surr0unding the cells was not high en0ugh t0 induce intracel1ular DAF - 2 ﬂu0rescence. These data reveal that the delivery of NO P. aeragih0Sa is signiﬁcantly m0re efﬁcient fr0m silica nan0particles than fr0m PROL1 / NO. As such , lower d0ses 0f NO delivered from silica nan0particles effectively kill the bacteria. The ability of the nan0particles t0 deliver appreciable NO payl0ads in cl0se pr0ximity t0 the bacteria1 cells all0ws the NO t0 m0re efﬁciently target cellular 00mp0nents ( e. g , cell membrane , DNA , pr0teins , etc. ) critical t0 cell function , circumventing the need f0r NO t0 diffuse acr0ss large distances in s01uti0n t0 reach the cell. As a lip0philic m0lecule , NO is capable 0f rapid1y cr0ssing cell membranes. The release 0f high levels 0f NO at 0r near the cell membrane w0uld be expected t0 1ead t0 high intrace11ular c0ncentrati0ns 0f NO. Membrane destructi0n via lipid per0xidation has been pr0p0sed as 0ne 0f the major mechanisms 0f NO - mediated bactericidal activity. As a per0xynitrite - dependent pr0cess requiring super0xide , NO released in cl0se proximity t0 a bactericidal cell would be expected t0 exert greater bactericidal effects than NO released diffusely thr0ugh0ut s0luti0n by generating a larger intracellular NO c0ncentrati0n. 1ndeed , we 0bserved direct evidence 0f membrane destructi0n during the c0nf0cal micr0sc0py experiments by the rapid appearance 0f intracel1ular P1 ﬂu0rescence in ce11s treated with NO - releasing si1ica nan0partic1es. By virtue 0f the extended NO - release half - life 0f the si1ica nan0particles relative to PROL1 / NO , a signiﬁcant porti0n 0f the NO is retained until after particle ass0ciati0n with the P. aeragih0sa cells. Such high localized NO release in cl0se proximity to the bacterial cells may then facilitate delivery of greater c0ncentrati0ns of NO and 0ther reactive species to the cell membrane and int0 the cell itself , leading t0 enhanced bactericidal efﬁcacy of NO delivered fr0m nan0particles.
