Moreover, it has been required to develop an agent having an enhanced antiobesity activity. Thus, it is intended to specify a carotenoid having a stronger antiobesity activity than fucoxanthin and provide an agent having an antiobesity activity and a method of inhibiting obesity by using the same. [MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS] As the results of intensive studies for finding a carotenoid having a stronger antiobesity activity than fucoxanthin and a material for economically obtaining the same, it is found out that these problems can be solved by using ascidian. Ascidian is a general name involving marine animals belonging to the phylum Chordata, the subphylum Urochordata, and the class Ascidiacea and these animals widely occur throughout the country. Fucoxanthinol is extracted from, in particular, the internal organs and shell of ascidian and it is clarified that this substance has a strong antiobesity activity.)

As alternatives to silver particles, other metallic particles (e. g. zinc, copper) or nanocrystalline actives can be incorporated (e. g. replacing the anti-oxidative silver by anti-oxidative nanocrystals of plant molecules such as hesperitin). This leads to combinations of lipid particles with nanocrystals for dermal use.)

384: (7363366097338251239) patent: WO2008010788A2 Title : COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR MAKING AND USING NANOEMULSIONS) Abstract : The present invention discloses an improved nanoemulsion comprising a uniform and discrete range of very small particle nano-sized diameters. This uniformity results in improved bioavailability of incorporated compounds (i. e., pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals) as reflected in various pharmacokinetic parameters including, but not limited to, decreased Tmax, increased Cmax, and increased AUC. The improved method of making these uniform nanoemulsions utilizes microfluidization which differs in both process and mechanics when compared to conventional milling and grinding techniques used to generate nanoparticulate compositions. Further, the improvement results, in part, from a novel step of mixing a substantially soluble compound into a heated dispersion medium. This is unlike current nanoparticulate composition methods that mix an insoluble compound with an unheated dispersion medium.; Further, these nanoemulsions are observed to be bacterial-resistant and stable to extremes in both temperature and pH changes.

580: (5277607562728357534) patent: US20080138851A1 Title : TROPHIC CONVERSION OF OBLIGATE PHOTOTROPHIC ALGAE THROUGH METABOLIC ENGINEERING) Abstract : Most microalgae are obligate photoautotrophs and their growth is strictly dependent on the generation of photosynthetically-derived energy. In this study it is shown that the microalga Phaeodaclylurn tricornutum can be engineered to import glucose and grow in the dark through the introduction of genes encoding glucose transporters. Both the human and Chlorella kessleri glucose transporters facilitated the uptake of glucose by P. tricornutum, allowing the cells to metabolize exogenous organic carbon and thrive, independent of light. This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene.; Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization. Finally, this work also represents critical progress toward large-scale commercial exploitation of obligate phototrophic algae through the use of microbial fermentation technology, eliminating significant limitations resulting from light-dependent growth.)

687: (5308347647781006755) patent: US20100093847A1 Title : ANTI-OBESITY ACTIVE AGENT AND ANTI-OBESITY METHOD) Abstract : [Problem] Fucoxanthin extracted from wakame seaweed (Undaria pinnatifida) is effective as an anti-obesity active agent. However, fucoxanthin is contained in mature (adult) brown algae in a small amount, and accordingly, it takes a long time and high cost to obtain fcoxanthin in an amount sufficient for practical use. Further, an anti-obesity active agent showing a stronger effect has been desired. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to specify a carotenoid exhibiting anti-obesity activity stronger than that of fucoxanthin and to provide an anti-obesity active agent and an anti-obesity method which use the caritenoid. [Means to Solve the Problem] Intensive and extensive studies have been made as to what carotenoid has an anti-obesity activity stronger than that of fucoxanthin and what material should be used in order to economically obtain such a carotenoid. As a result, the answer has been found that the carotenoid is fucoxanthinol. "Sea squirt (ascidian)" is a generic name of marine animals which belong to class Ascidiacea, subphylum Urochordata (Tunicata), phylum Chordata and which live nationwide. As described above, sea squirt (ascidian) is abundantly found as resources. In the present invention, fucoxanthinol is extracted particularly from internal organs and hard skins of sea squirt (ascidian), and it has been revealed that fucoxanthinol exhibits strong anti-obesity activity.)

The algal cells are ruptured sufficiently to promote froth flotation of the cells from the suspension. The algal suspension is introduced into the top of the Jameson cell downcomer and passed through an orifice plate therein to generate a free liquid jet of the suspension. The jet is plunged downwardly through a gas and the gas is transported with the jet through a gas and liquid interface into the algal suspension. The momentum of the jet is dissipated, which disperses the gas into fine bubbles. The fine bubbles are intimately contacted with the aqueous suspension in concurrent downward flow in a collection zone to absorb the algal bodies onto the surfaces of the bubbles. A froth of bubble and algal agglomerates is formed and collapsed to obtain a dewatered algal concentrate. The Jameson cell can be operated at sufficient inlet pressures so that the algal cells are ruptured by passing them through the orifice rather than in a separate step.)
