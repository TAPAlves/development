CA2407806C Use of heparin or nonanticoagulant heparin for inhibiting apoptosis arising from ischemia perfusion injury Heparin reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury to myocardium. This effect has been attributed complement inhibition, but heparin also has other activities that might diminish ischemia-reperfusion. To further probe these mechanisms, we compared heparin and an O-desulfated nonanticoagulant heparin with greatly reduced anti-complement activity. Given at the time of coronary artery reperfusion in a canine model of myocardial infarction, both heparin and O-desulfated heparin equally reduced neutrophil adherence to ischemic-reperfused coronary artery endothelium, influx of neutrophils into ischemic-reperfused myocardium, myocardial necrosis and release of creatine kinase into plasma. Heparin and O-desulfated heparin also prevented dysfunction of endothelial-dependent coronary relaxation following ischemic injury. In addition, heparin and O-desulfated heparin inhibited translocation of the transcription factor NF-.KAPPA.B from cytoplasm to the nucleus in human endothelial cells and decreased NF-.KAPPA.B DNA binding in human endothelium and ischemic-reperfused rat myocardium. Thus, heparin and nonanticoagulant heparin decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury by disrupting multiple levels of the inflammatory cascade, including the novel observation that heparins inhibit activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-.KAPPA.B.
